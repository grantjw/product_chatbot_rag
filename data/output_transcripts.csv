https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySfpU9d9Z2c,this will be first of all the first step of the routine and uh so i'm deciding to start with this one um esop is an australian brand uh which has been around for over 20 years and now has offices all over the world um this um well if i'm introducing you to esub so the branding is amazing and the packaging is amazing all the esa products are this amber glass uh which a looking incredible they're sort of like you know the medicine you know uh maybe late 50s um you know the little bottle bottles and first of all it's more second of all it's more sustainable so um right here this cleanser does not have a pump as you can see which is not a problem for me personally uh but if it is for you you can get it separately and switch it between bottles uh for me again as i said it is not so you can easily just uh because it's gel so don't pour out a lot really a little is enough um this cleanser here as i said is a gel cleanser it is called into minds which is for combination skin so if you guys have combination skin this one is perfect also esop's product esop's products are oriented to white acne as well i don't have acne myself but started uh i have some breakouts um maybe sweat on this stupid masks silver masks sorry for the outbreak but um you know they are annoying what can i say uh so i'm working out in the gym probably that's what causing it hi meg how are you doing today um so if you are looking for a cleanser for yourself or for somebody else as a gift because esap is a beautiful brand to give it's a well-known gift it's a luxury considered a luxury brand and looking amazing in your bathroom and also amazing as a product for your skin so in two minutes cleanser as i said before it's for combination skin so if you have combination skin if you have oil oily or dry skin both of them work and again if you have dry and oil oily at the same time it works too so uh it has witch hazel it has salicylic acid and sage leaf as part of the ingredients uh it also has um lavender oil it has i think coconut a lot of the ingredients that are making sure that your skin is not dry afterwards so when you're stripping all the dirt when you're stripping all the all the oils and cleaning your pores or cleaning your makeup this cleanser is also making sure that it's not over dried which is a very very very important so uh let's see this is how much i'm going to use into mine's cleanser and general esop cleanser um comes in handy for me especially when i wear makeup for photoshoots or videos or anything if i need to shoot i am using this cleanser just this much and i'm using it once or twice and the face is clean from the makeup and in general clean is um uh in general in general so i'm gonna apply a little now i have to make my skin damp so i'm gonna apply a little water as well and you'll see that this cleanser isn't um going to foam a little so this is as much as you gonna get but uh trust me as i have done before uh you are going to get a clean face either it is just the dirt is it either it is just the oils or either it's a makeup that you were wearing the whole day and cannot wait to strip it off so literally very gentle smells like i'm gonna say siege but uh i can like really distinguish but it's not like a added fragrance very natural smell very herby so i'm done with the cleanser gonna just wash it away give me just one second don't go far for now what you can do is add it to your bag because look at the price the price is reduced to like 15 percent for you to have an amazing experience during chopping light so here we are uh it's 28 for this concert which is about 50 milliliters or a hundred that means a 100 milliliters bottle and um it has been with me since the beginning of summer this cleanser and maybe even before a little before that and uh wow i'm really like still on top i'm using this one when i'm stripping my makeup off so as you can see i don't wear makeup that much uh okay the next step let's go let's continue so this was in two minds cleanser okay it's for combination skin uh gel cleanser so very gentle on your skin super gentle stripping all the oils but not stripping away the moisture because the natural oils that are in this cleanser are making sure that your face your skin is um you know still moisturized so you're good uh the next step would be the toner at least in this routine and let me put it for you right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsVtjGDv4z0,one that one's a little bit less expensive i think that one's a smaller bottle it's more of like this is the large bottle and as you can see it's really huge this one's 16.9 fluid ounces um so that other one's going to be like a little bit smaller but yeah this one's a rose by any other name body cleanser super excited for this one i haven't tried that scent yet sometimes i always want to say flavor but flavor is when you're like eating something scent is obviously when you're smelling it i don't know why that confuses me whatever let me know if that confuses you too um another body oil that is amazing is from this line marine and vine and this one makes you so glad

helping you to get the most out of your skin care so if you haven't already now it's a fantastic time to click that link below and subscribe to the channel ring the notification bell and you won't miss out many of our amazing future content today's video will be doing a full brand review in this series we look at the best the worst within the brand we take the whole brand apart we look at each individual product the good the bad the pros the cons what you need to spend your money on and any products that you just need to avoid today we are talking about this brand Aesop it is an Australian brand they're fabulous because most of their products are vegan they are cruelty free they have a great environmental sustainability record and they look beautiful they hit the shelves around the time that Instagram became a huge thing at the timing for this company was perfect because this is the most Instagram of all packaging ever it became a design sensation they started the utilitarian style of packaging just went mad and a stop of the first to really come on board with that most people buy it because I like the packaging they couldn't care less what's in the bottle I am a huge believer that you have to be drawn to a product the product has to look good I also think that the packaging has to reflect the quality of packages should reflect the quality of the products inside I won't buy something just because of the packaging that's a lie I have bought things just because the packaging but you shouldn't do as I say not as I do do not buy things just because the packaging okay we're gonna get into this and we're gonna work out whether the products inside are as gorgeous as the packaging on the outside we're not gonna go in any particular order unlike pixie which was the last one we did I'll link the video of that where there was like 36 different products a sub only have six skin care specific products they do have extra ones they have mouthwashes toothpaste shampoos I'm just dealing with the things that go on the skin so we're gonna tackle those in this video and we're gonna go into the lipid detail about each one and work out whether you need the product in your life or you don't straight off the bat I'd love you to know have you tried these products you heard of it do you like the look of it leave me a comment below I'd love to know your thoughts and let's get into it so first of all is this this is the rose by any other name body cleanser now you know something's expensive when it's called a cleanser not a wash but this is basically a shower it smells heavenly I don't usually like the smell of rose but they've mixed it with cardamom and black pepper so it's kind of like a Middle East and Rosie smokes like dark and yet still quite floral it is a beautiful scent well this is I say it is genuinely unisex I mean I hate gendered fragrances I mean if you like I sent you like a scent it rings as a matter on your agenda but this is a genuine unisex episode I think anybody could love if you have this in your shower you will look the part you will smell the part and the whole bathroom after you've used it smells of that sort of dark rose it's just a very exotic very expensive snowing product I love it 22 pounds here in the UK not sure on the pricing in the US but give it a Google I think it'll be around the $30 point do I think you need to spend $30 on a body wash no just do I keep repurchasing this absolutely someone bought me this as a gift for Christmas thinking I love the packaging and didn't think that I actually usually quite hate the smell of rose but I love it i'm not like bottle 3 and this is now my go to body wash sensational stunning gorgeous worth worth money and some people might say you does have a mess or sodium lauryl sulfate in there which should be quite drying I don't think that's an issue most body wash does it what matters there it creates that lather I think that's absolutely fine for most people if you have very dry skin eczema dermatitis then obviously you know the drill you don't want to give me this product but I think on the body it's absolutely fine different issue when it comes to the face but I don't think there's any problem with that people with normal and skin with it with that doesn't have a compromised barrier function perfect I love that product similar product but slightly different so is that the parsley seed cleanser leave an image of it they're 27 pounds here in the UM in the UK $35 in the US I want to like this front I mean two minds about this product so I used it the smell is gorgeous it's again it's that sort of earthy herby but it's a beautiful beautiful scent it's got lactic acid in it which whilst I don't ever think you should have an active ingredient in your cleanser necessarily because you're putting it on and you're washing it off it's a nice to have it's got like to kassadin better than it not having that end and it smells gorgeous and really does hydrate the skin it's got a few minutes in there and it's one of the few cleansers I've used when I've washed it off foaming cleansers where I've washed it off I've not felt dry afterwards does have sodium lauryl sulfate and so it will be drying to some extent and anybody that has a compromised barrier function on the skin should avoid this product and is it going to be my go-to cleanser no I think it is I just don't like some of those ingredients the family I prefer a non foaming cleanser because I think you can just do away with the sodium lauryl sulfate you don't need it in your life it's only because you want this affecting quality that you end up with it in the product so it's not my go-to it is a nice product I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 because I think the smell is nice and it does leave your skin hydrated there's some pretty greedy insane there that don't think it necessary the packaging is gorgeous the delivery methods gorgeous a little goes a long way the prices were expensive overall I think it's good product and if you want to try one thing from a stop isn't the body wash I think this should be something you try I think you'll love the smell and I think as long as you haven't got a particularly dry complexion I think you absolutely love the product you think do very clearly marketed this on their website for drab for oily and combination oily skin so actually a lot of the a little bit of drying isn't a bad thing for people with those skin types so I think it's marketed correctly I do wish the doorway with some of those ingredients but I think it's marketed correctly the smell is gorgeous and the product is fantastic the lactic acid is just a nice extra nice to have will leave you hydrated and it doesn't dry too much God's product six out of ten now we're going to be a purifying pure let me get my words out purifying facial exfoliant paste believe that that again the packaging is spot-on looks like toothpaste it's innovative it's different this has a lactic acid in again most of the products are lactic acid based don't know why they've chosen like to cast it over like colic acid which is a standard but again is slightly different so it's giving you something that's slightly different my issue with this is it's got crushed quartz in it I don't I don't understand in this day I we have crushed metals kristan minerals crushed stones what is that all about it's too aggressive on the skin and you just don't need it in your life I would have loved them to learn a pace that was just lactic acid based and done away with that manual exfoliation which I think is damaging to the skin and can actually do more harm than good the products 35 pounds which is very expensive for a manual exfoliant it's a hard pass from me I don't think the course is adding anything other than potential irritation damage to the skin the lactic acid is should be enough on its own to deliver that I think they should reformulate this take out the course bump up the power of the lactic acid and they would have me as a buyer because again smell is lovely it is fragrance but again I think this is a theme of their products they do have that fragrance the fragrance is nice if you're sensitive this won't be for you anyway but no this is a firm pass I'm gonna give it a two out of ten they get the latch Cassidy is nice so they're getting a point for that it's cruelty free they get a point for that the rest just a hard pass I don't think you need this moving up to this product which is that fabulous facial oil 39 pounds right off the bat do you need to spend 39 pounds on the facial oil do you hack no I've done a whole video on drugstore facial oils which I'll link up there you can get them for $5 don't know why spending your money on this it's a beautiful combination of oils smell is heavenly and it's mixed together beautifully so it sticks into the skin it's not too greasy yeah it's still hydrating so it's ding-ding-ding when it comes to what it delivers I just think the price is too much for what is in fact available at the drugstore for five to ten dollars and the packaging is beautiful the delivery is beautiful all of that I can't take that away from them and the mix of oils is nice but fairly standard if this was 19 pounds rather than 39 I'd be saying give it a go worth the pun I think it's too expensive for what it is and what it delivers but it is a nice facial oil and again if you won't dip your toe if you want the aesthetic of having this beautiful packaging on your Basin and something you would actually use if you don't mind spending 40 pounds on a product this is a nice facial oil I'm giving it 6 out of 10 because again I'm knocking the points off of the price but the actual formulation is beautiful the mix of oils is really nice scent is really lovely and it does hydrate the skin without leaving it too greasy so from all that perspective it's great I just with the price is a little bit much for the actual combination of oils that you're getting if that make sense now moving to that antioxidant she's that past receipt antioxidant they love that past they seem to be mad for parsley it's one of their signature fragrances but it does smell lovely this antioxidant is fantastic plant extracts are great the chlorophyll in plants is packed full of antioxidants so anything that has plant mastery is going to be a powerful and fantastic antioxidant this is no exception and I love the formulation I adore adore the way it applies its serum is light you barely know you're wearing it it smells nice but it's a natural friggin again natural fragrances you can still be sensitive to but it is natural it's not synthetic so just be aware of that beautiful product honestly the lights on I would definitely definitely definitely recommend this if it wasn't for the 57 pounds price tag now if you have a little bit of extra cash and you want to treat yourself and you want to enjoy a product that's a little bougie a little extra you know you vent your money you deserve a treat this is a really good product I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 I love the antioxidant I love the way it's formulated I love the ingredients list I love the scent I loved it everything about it that look the scent and the packaging and the ingredients are spot-on the two points are coming off because of that price pub which i think is unobtainable odd I do need to spend that when you could get a much cheaper antioxidant doesn't mean you have to be cheap though you could spend your money on this and again if you want that beautiful aesthetic and you want to try a new product and you want to treat yourself this would be a fantastic product to do just that I love it finally we have the lightweight facial hydrating serum they really image of that there and this this is the firm pass I have it's expensive in the UK it's 48 pounds in the u.s. it's around the $60 point this is expensive and it is hyaluronic acid it is few order other adding a humectants it's a nice smell that is it you'd be better just getting the Neutrogena ahem moisturizer that I always rave on about the hydro boost is gorgeous you could get a matte the inky list they've just come out with vitamins A vitamin oyster Iser which is really nice similar consistency and yeah just a fraction of the price it's the price on this just puts me off it's a nice product there's nothing wrong with it but it's not delivering anything there's no active ingredients in there it's nothing beyond just hydrating facial serum lovely to use the scent is nice I just don't feel you need to spend that much money I don't think I could just if I recommend to get on that basis so that's it it's a short product line but an iconic one I think like I say it was a design a sensation and people have this if you look at any instrument it's so Instagram abort the search a stop on Instagram you'll see all the beautiful packaging and it'll make you want to buy it if you're bought if you're sold on the packaging and you want the lifestyle that goes with this product I would fully recommend you get the rose by any other name body cleanser beautiful in the shower his-and-hers perfect anybody can use it I love this it is just it wakes you up in the morning it makes you feel fabulous before you go to bed everything about it is lovely it basically makes your whole bathroom smell absolutely divine definitely would recommend that the fabulous base oil if you want to spend 40 pounds on the face oil is rid is a good product it's well formulated product and I would recommend it I just don't think you need to spend that money but as a treat you absolutely could fur passes for me and that the exfoliating pace that's actually potentially dangerous to the skin leave that forget the facial serum the hydrating facial serum it's doing nothing and the cheaper alternatives and parsley seed cleanse that yes if you're very oily and you're not worried about few drying ingredients for anyone else I think it'll just be a bit drying and a bit stripping for the skin guys I hope you've enjoyed this review I love this bra I mean I'm so tired I want to give this I want to say they could reformulate and do better but I love this product so I bought into the brand let me know your thoughts your comments I want to hear all about it give this video a thumbs up follow us on over an Instagram and I cannot wait to see you in the next video guys wherever you are take care of yourself and take care of one another take yeah bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCzrjPfbGVs,aesop's parsley seed antioxidant eye cream i love aesop products because they do the work they're made out of natural ingredients and they are this eye cream is super hydrating and amazing it's made out of parsley seed it has vitamin e and vitamin c so you know what you're that's going to be hydrating and detoxifying as well um it's easy to put on you see here it is thick so all you need is a little bit and it's easily absorbed into the skin so if i was doing this i would just dab it like that and make sure that you don't pull your skin underneath your eye because it's super sensitive um and you don't want to cause additional additional lines or additional like stress on your skin so yeah like that and i am ready for the day um i think it's great because you can also use it here underneath you know over your top left because that tends to get dry for me and then here if you wanted to make sure that you don't create any lines um when you smile or just want additional hydration and in different parts of your face i think that this is a great price point and it also lasts very very long especially if you use it sparingly because a little bit goes a long way i think that's a common theme especially when it comes with the things that i purchase i'm really finding amazing products that do the work with a little um right now it's 73.95 but you can get an additional fifteen percent off if you check off during the live um just a shout out to vera shop you can get 15 off um more on anything more or less uh on vera shop if you shop during any other like live streaming or social shopping events or parties so definitely take advantage of these shops or these really good deals because you know they have the best deals and the prices are unbeatable especially with an oversaturated beauty market um at least that's what i have found especially when i go shopping but yeah this is asos parsley seed antioxidant eye cream um normally i would put it not laid on too thick i would lay it on a little bit thicker in the evenings because i want to make sure that you know my your skin is being repaired uh it's the under eye area is super moisturized because i want to prevent fine lines you know i'm getting older so i want to make sure that i'm taking care of my skin and i think that everyone should just practice great skincare whether that's you know drinking a lot of water make sure that you're wearing sunblock um and also just finding great products that work for you um i've messed around so many different products which is why like i talk about the products that i love here um but everyone's skin is different so just remember that and make sure to test the product really do the research um before you start putting it on your face because you never know what's gonna happen but you know all these products have worked for me especially it's with someone that has eggs in our someone that has sensitive skin um my skin tends to be more or less like a combination skin so oily and dry more dry during the winter but yeah these products have definitely worked and are my summer skincare essentials um does anyone have any questions just feel free to use the chat if you do and um and yeah we'll quickly recap all of the products that we talked about this is flower and spices instant glow calming exfoliator it's made out of fennel lavender and other essential oils it has some bamboo particles for exfoliation it's the right amount of hydration and exfoliation in my honest opinion especially if you are someone that spends a lot of time in the sun aha is great because it helps exfoliate but the other ingredients in here ensure that you know it's exfoliating and it's also nourishing too so that's um that's something that's a plus to me especially when you're out and about because you don't want your skin to to to do dry or harsh chemicals or things like that it's also all organic which is nice it's it's i don't know it's just great and the size is just amazing it's easy to apply it doesn't run especially if you leave it on your face and it just reveals glowier skin i mean um next we have our arlene and coz the volcanic clay cleansing bar this is one of the most hydrating soap bars that i've ever used it has volcanic clay coconut oil and also olive oil the volcanic clay helps to absorb any kind of impurities and also has an exfoliating effect and the coconut helps to clean and nourish and the olive oil helps to nourish even more so i think it's the right amount of nourishment and cleaning that that works for me um and also it's funded by yale so you know yale's behind it they know they know what's up they definitely know what they're doing but jokes aside you know phd chemists actually created the formula um so this this is probably why it's one of the best soap bars that i've used personally um i use it on my body i've used it on my face but i think it's the perfect travel companion especially if you're doing some summer travel um it smells it's unscented which is great if you have nourished um if you have sensitive skin like me um i was just checking because you never know especially with coconut but i think they've extracted it so it's in its purest form without the scent um if you would like to purchase as well it comes with this soap dish um plate which absorbs water and moisture so you're not having this weird gelatinous kind of bar if you just leave it on the side um but it's great i think it's super chic it's beautiful um i'll definitely be taking these with me to mexico tomorrow and then next we have reebox b77 is just hyaluronic acid which is awesome hyaluronic acid is amazing because it moisturizes your skin and helps protect your skin barrier by helping you retain all of the moisture um this is why i use it after my toner because i feel like the toner will just absorb easily and into my skin and it's normally number one or number two in my care stuff especially during the summer because you know you're traveling you're moving around you're dehydrated you're losing water so um in addition to drinking a lot of fluids and a lot of them and use and using my my entire skincare routine um this is something that i feel like everyone should have but make sure that you test things on your skin because what works for me may not work for you but i mean i have so many different skin ailments but i feel like if i can use it you could probably um and then next we have a reebok's b77 just squalling um which is amazing because squalene improves elasticity it's an oil um it doesn't feel greasy it easily absorbs and it's so so so so hydrating so after after i use my toner or hyaluronic acid i'll use swallowing just like a couple of drops and i'll put it around my face i'll massage it into my face and my neck area and then i'll follow up with moisturizer in case i needed intense moisturizing my skin tends to be more on the dryer side so that's that's why i have this multi-step approach and it's a great price too i believe it's a 10.99 or something like that and an additional 15 off if you check out during my life um yeah and then the last thing that we've already discussed is asos parsley seed um under eye cream which is super hydrating it's filled with vitamin e and vitamin c which are hydrating nourishing and having antioxidants in them so they really do help fight free radicals and things like that on your skin so it's perfect it goes on pretty easily a little bit goes a long way so i would definitely get into it um but yeah i mean i had so much fun talking about my summer skincare essentials if anybody has any questions don't hesitate to drop me a line on bear shop or follow me on instagram my handle is jd.loveless i'm island kid in the city and thank you for tuning in to my my party uh and really just learning more about my summer skincare essentials see you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMSYlbntNbs,up this is their resurrection aromatic aromatique hand cream it's they're calling it a hand balm it has notes of mandarin rhine rosemary leaf and cedar atlas it smells amazing i'm just going to go ahead and take off my rings to show you what it looks like and give it a good application here's the packaging this is what it looks like and here's the back side go ahead and open it up if you can see that and just squeeze a little bit out this is more than enough honestly this is all that you need take that much and then just go ahead and rub it into the skin make sure that you also pay attention to the cuticles i kind of just go like this and rub the top of my cuticles with the product to make sure that we get them hydrated as well i love that this product has a really nice smell to it it's not overpowering it doesn't compete with any other fragrance that i may have on and i also really like that it's not sticky and it's not too greasy sometimes hand creams can be too rich and then once you start to move about your day like you're making fingerprints everywhere because you've got greasy hands or like your hands are sticky and suddenly you feel like you have to wash them because you just can't move around with the product not the case with this product here it's a light cream but it's also very effective it does wonders on the cuticles i have to say my cuticles have been looking a lot better since i've been using it and applying it to them on the nightly basis how i like to use it is i just keep it by my bedside um right before i go to sleep right before like literally right before when i'm turning down to go to sleep i'll take it out of the dresser take off the cap go ahead and put that little like dime size amount on and then i just work it through like what i'm doing right now it's very simple it's very very simple and a little bit really does go a long way i feel like with continued use you would definitely see an improvement in your skin and the tone and the texture of your skin the hydration of your skin and certainly the cuticles because we're living in a time where we're always washing our hands constantly right and not only are we always washing our hands constantly we're also putting hand sanitizer on our hands which it which could totally dry it out it completely dries it out so for as much damage as you do to your hands you want to make sure that you're taking a moment to really condition them like really condition them and really give them a chance to kind of repair themselves for me the best time to do this is at night because during the day i'm still moving around i'm still you know kind of dunking my hands in and out of water so it's just never a good time but i always make sure that i make time at the end of my evenings to go ahead and repair what i have on my hands and there you go these are what my hands look like you see they're not too greasy they're not too they're not oily they're not sticky you know like i can press around on things and not leave marks they're really really great it's a great product and i love to travel with it so that being said it's been about 15 minutes now so and it is all the time that i have here left on the live i want to thank you so much for joining um at 6 30 i will be back on the live stream so join me then you can see me with a clear fresh face so you can see the results of the mask and the eye treatments um definitely follow me here on the vera shop platform tune in at 6 30 we're going to be talking hair care finds things that i look for in hair care products that i found here on the vera shop app and i'm absolutely obsessed with so thank you again for watching don't forget to watch what's up next with the other vloggers and streamers on the channel i love you forever and i will catch you in the next one bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHt-pBFdDUk,back to skincare okay so back to things that you should be doing the night before your big day actually not even the night before you should be doing this like kind of leading up to the big day so i love this um mask from asap so this one i like to put on this is definitely a nighttime mask so unlike a lot of the sheet masks that you could probably pull off like you know the day of or right before you're putting on makeup um this one from aesop i definitely highly recommend this for night time only um because you definitely want it to work overnight it just has all this goodness in there i can't really speak to where all that goodness is i'm not a dermatologist i didn't come up with the formula but i will say i swear by it it does leave your skin really refreshing and glowing when you wake up in the morning um anybody who has joined today you guys are going to get 15 off uh this aesop um replenishing mask is coming out to 106 a stop items rarely come on sale so definitely take advantage of that so that's a really good deal um and then one last thing what okay all right these last two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7tTL-nXbes&t=354s&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,beneath the signature amber colored bottles text Heavy packaging and physical stores that each look like something out of an architectural Digest Magazine is a brand that's been around since 1987. so we're getting some people in the office to use the brujiest 40 hand wash and getting their thoughts pulled in another tribute okay so I'm just gonna get you to wash your hands with this this is Celine she's from Germany wow what that was so unexpected it has like grainy stuff in it what is it called it's like exfoliating oh yeah exfoliating sorry I'm German he has a fellow Aussie quite nice it's not too abrasive here's Colin I just found him it feels really good I didn't even expect this this is really like taking me to a new place I've never been before as far as hand soaps this is Brandon I feel like this is a most serious hand washing experience than what I generally have and it smells good too not just a normal hand soap I would go with you can buy a hand soap normally I don't mean I don't maybe one or two dollars tell me what you think this costs maybe 30 to 50 bucks okay you would actually be right there's just something so satisfying in products that are designed classically simply and traditionally whether you care for bougie high-end soaps hand bombs or even perfumes there is one brand Within These ranks that have actually been producing skin care since its Inception about three decades ago and I'm sure you've seen it and if you're not convinced even Haley Biebs is on board as Nano likes to make them in the cupcake tin no not the muffins yep right there that's why today we're gonna be exploring ESOP like do people come in and say it differently people say ASAP all the time the brand is called Esau is and they've managed to stay ahead of the trends while remaining largely silent subscribe so my curiosity actually started about a month ago when I was back home in Australia and I realized walking around that their Pinterest like aesthetic Spa stores no two of them were the same they were all uniquely different from the marble sinks to the brass tapware and all their clean shelves oh my God kiss and when covid hit it was a time when everyone was really concentrating on hand hand washing which propelled their already cult favorite hand wash even further to become mainstream especially for people who wanted a little bit of self-care so that it wasn't just a chore to wash our hands it was more of an experience a new life pleasure if you will and don't underestimate our humble hands because the hand washing Market was worth 2.5 billion in 2020 but that's projected to be doubled and worth about 5 billion your hand is like the closest thing to your face skin that's why we do everything like on the back yeah even when we try skincare we put it on the back of your hand and now we're going to wrap your hand thank you thank you yay this is like the best part of a manicure too yes exactly but it's not just all about our hands right what else did this brand do to turn mainstream while keeping so humble and it all started in Melbourne Australia when a hairdresser by the name of Dennis perfidas began mixing essential oils into hair products because he realized how bad the ammonia in these hair dye products smelt so you wanted to alleviate and make it more of a pleasurable experience as people were getting their hair done if you've never seen their products you might have recognized some of this since and is probably in some combination of Rosemary citrus peel Bergamot or even cedar because all the products within the ESOP brand are formulated with essential oils and the formulations combine both natural and lab made ingredients that are known for their earthy and herbal scents let's now look a little bit into the aesthetic starting from the bottle the black and white lettering between alternating black and cream solids is pretty ident defiable from miles away they use minimalistic wording using the fonts helvetica and Optimum medium and the macron die critic which is this straight bar over the E on the label lets you know that it's pronounced ESOP so even from this it's kind of a brand that's like if you know you know now before we get into my review let's talk about price in an interview with Dennis where he was asked about the price of the hand bomb he was basically unperturbed critics are at the Liberty to use other products there's no justification required we make exceptional products with great care and attention so there you go that's badass because he's just super confident about the quality of his products you might have even noticed that they don't really do marketing like you haven't seen them on billboards buses you haven't really heard from them from influences so what do they actually do to get their name out there it really is just through organic word of mouth so to get into the mood of the hall let's go and spray my living room and then we'll continue that foreign [Music] so I got my hands on about 10 new products from the ESOP line all in different categories from skincare to mouthwash toothpaste serums and so I want to let you know which ones I think are worth spending the money on which ones if you haven't tried anything from them you might want to explore and which ones maybe are just worth the skip okay so let's start on I guess the cult favorite which is the hand wash or the bomb like the body bomb or the hand bomb I have the reverence aromatic hand wash this is actually one of the two main lines of their hand wash products each of them go for forty dollars each and it's in this 16.9 fluid ounce or 500 mL so I know 40 dollars is pretty steep for you know a hand wash if you compare it to a lot of other brands in this range like LA labo or even by radio forty dollars actually sits snugly in the middle because I know buy radio sells ones for like 60 something dollars the labo has like a hand soap that goes for 55 this is the reverence as I said and I actually prefer this over the cult favorite the resurrection aromatic hand wash and this is actually the version that contains finely milled pumice so this one does have that physical exfoliation property which I really love because it's like that extra like luxury at home or spa-like experience that you can recreate at home some people might not like you know the exfoliating properties every single day or using it every time they wash their hands so I'd say this is also a great like alternative to having other soaps and hand washes and I won't go for this all the time so in that respect I can see why this isn't like a necessity but if you want to go for more of that everyday hand wash I would suggest that you can find the ones without the pumice stone so I really love this one it is the reverence and I actually had no idea what reverence really meant so I Googled it and it is defined as deep respect expect for someone or something which I love I just find it really does make a difference when you know you're washing your hands and you're like and you're really like in tune with what you're smelling how it's making you feel as a practice of presence so moving on the next thing I picked up in the store was the Lucent facial concentrate so when I picked it up off the shelf I looked at the ingredients it's got rose petals sodium ascorbal phosphate and niacinamide so from this we know it's a vitamin C and niacinamide serum designed to balance combination as well as oily skin types the most exciting thing for this room is that I realized and solidified while it was in Australia that I think I react to Ill ascorbic acid because two or three times that I've tried a new vitamin C serum I instantly get like really irritated itchy and I have a rash like a low-key rash for about two weeks for it to fully disappear so so then right at the end of my trip was when I got this and I'm like okay I'm gonna try a derivative of vitamin C to see if it still happens and I didn't break out I didn't get a face rash I didn't get irritated it wasn't drying and I can tell you I love it so the serum is this really lightweight gel consistency then I looked into the ingredients and found that it actually does have an extract of red algae which is called sodium carrageenan and then the finish of it was that it left my face feeling like a little bit tacky and then I fanned it out a little bit and then it just like really dissolved into my skin to become more of this like satin to like semi mattifying almost but really hydrated people hate on essential oils all the time but me being a person with sensitive skin I actually found that this worked better than like other ingredients that aren't formulated with so it just goes to show so it depends on the oil it depends on your skin it depends on everyone what I don't love is the price it's a hundred and twenty dollars and I'm like whoa okay that's that's pretty expensive but I would say if I think about it people are selling vitamin C serums for more than a hundred dollars anyway those vitamin C's might be saying that it's pure ill ascorbic acid which is why they can charge high for it because it's you know the the source of vitamin C but then to me now I'm like I can't even use those products anyway next is actually a kit so in the store when we were browsing they had these like boxes so there was two there was an arrival and a departure and because I was about to leave back to New York I was like you know what the departure sounds good and actually it was far superior to the arrivals I would say because it comes with seven different products either a mini sized or full sized so this is a great way I feel feel like if you want to try a bunch of their products without committing to full size can I tell you this kit is a 10 out of 10. you get a lip product there's a toothpaste there's a hydrating mask which is like a moisturizer there's the resurrection aromatic hand balm in the small version then they have a rinse free hand wash Perfection mouthwash even more Perfection and this immediate moisture facial hydrosol which is a facial Mist I first want to start off with this blue chamomile facial hydrating mask whoa whoa whoa this is essentially like a hydrating overnight mask you can use it two ways using it as a 30 minute mask and then you wipe the excess off and just like Pat the rest in or you can use it as like your moisturizer to sleep overnight and then wash it off in the morning what it contains is niacinamide sodium carrageenan which is that red algae again and bisibal which is the blue chamomile we've heard of bitterball in a lot of soothing calming like Korean formulated skincare products Lord knows everyone who's been on a long distance flight has come off the plane with five new pimples cracked skin you're just dehydrated you're like cops and it's just not cute so before the flight I went into the bathroom washed my face did my whole routine using the hydrate uh the hydrosol facial Mist as well as this I kid you not when we arrive back in New York got off the plane even Thomas was like your skin looks great something of that form I was like still half asleep but I was like what and then I went to the toilet looked in the mirror and I was like oh my God I only applied this once throughout the time from Taiwan back to New York and my skin was actually plump and it looked like you know when you first wake up your Skin's like a little bit puffy but it looks really smooth and it's really like plump that was actually how my skin looked using this and that was the first time I've ever stepped off a plane and had that feeling normally I'm itchy I have a bajillion pimples my T-Zone is all over the place and then I have to recover for the next five days so I was like whoa if you're looking for a soothing calming overnight mask that can do it like okay so let's talk about the hydrating Mist next it's called the immediate moisture facial hydrosol this one is a beautiful scent once again like more of that earthy woodsy Rosy scent I would say this one is not a standout in my view because I've used a bunch of really like great facial Mist like I enjoy the quarterly one more because it has that layer of like essential oil oils and it did the job of toning my face hydrating my face prepping my face pairing up these two on the flight but I don't think I'll be repurchasing this one so the next thing quickly is the resurrection aromatic hand bomb remember I was saying that they have reverence and Resurrection for the hand wash and hand bomb this is just the small one of the Resurrection the consistency of the hand bombs are so great because it's not too thick it's also not sticky which I really despise I don't like anything that's actually overly thick and hydrating for a handbag um it was the best duo that came with the rinse free hand wash that they have so this is also the resurrection rinse free hand wash so see what I mean where they produce multiple products within the same Aroma line so these two are like a matching pair and it's got the same notes you can buy this for ten dollars individually as well if you need it didn't leave a sticky feeling it wasn't like overly aromatic or smell like alcohol you know sometimes a lot of them smelling alcohol much more subtle than the hand cream so if you're going for something where you want people to smell your hands as you move it around then hand cream is the way to go but um the hand wash is a nice subtle scent that eventually Fades and it doesn't leave any sort of residue on your hand so you feel nice fresh and clean another thing that I got convinced through this was actually twofold so once at the store Thomas is a fan of mouthwash he loves you know Crest mouthwash any sort of mouthwash he uses it every day and I'm like you are not putting that on the bathroom counter so when we went in there I was like oh there's a mouthwash do you want to try it and he's like yeah okay so he tries it gives me a cup as well and then I tried it and I was like oh my God and then the departure kit actually has a mini mouthwash how considerate this is just like more fresh than it is painful I would say other ones are kind of like painful and burning you know oral hygiene is a thing I went to the dentist for the first time in six years I'm not proud of it and I realized that I had a bunch of cavities and I might need to take out all four of my wisdom teeth and I was like modified this is your reminder to floss every day so I would highly recommend you go to the ESOP store and try their mouthwash okay the last two things is a lip product as well as a toothpaste so let's start with the Cedar and citrus lip self so this is nice because your lips are perpetually parched even if you're like me and they're not normally dry they're dry on the plane let me tell you the ingredients for this one is grapefruit rind Ceda Atlas and orange rind this is really interesting it's like a gel oil lip product or like lip ointment and it's not thick and I've been using this before I go to sleep and it just keeps it nice and supple and it actually smells Divine it gives your lips more of a glossy finish compared to you know your typical lip balm but I will say that it wears off faster than like your like thick beeswax type of bombs so just depending on what it is that you want although the oil really does hydrate I don't know among other things if I would repurchase this one but for me it's a nice to have and very enjoyable to use because it's not sticky last thing is this toothpaste if you don't know mint is added into toothpaste just to give you that psychological feeling that you're fresh and clean right but it doesn't actually do much other than the feeling of moment it feels like a really clean toothpaste it doesn't foam and froth like another Colgate or like Crest you know typical toothpaste does but it just like cleans the teeth and gums and still has that minty freshness but just subdued and subtle so if you're into like clean toothpastes or the feeling of kind of like clean toothpaste I feel like this is something that you actually might enjoy so I would say if you're traveling guys try and get this departure kit next is also in the Wheelhouse of like aromatherapy it's the ginger flight therapy so this is essentially a roll-on like aromatic oil it's got ginger root lavender and geranium so I thought this would be just a fun purchase more than anything it's got the effects of soothing mentally and what you do is just roll this onto all your pulse points like you can put it on your temple your neck your wrists and from those areas that generate heat it will help like I don't know have that Aroma around but I have been using this uh since we got back at night because I'm still jet lagged and I can't sleep at night and I'm wide awake at 4am and so hasn't been able to put me to rest not really but I do feel calm it's also great to have in the office just as kind of like your pick-me-up as well if you need a little reset so I would say my top three items that I would recommend would be these three the reverence aromatic hand wash the facial concentrate with vitamin C and niacinamide as well as the uh blue chamomile facial hydrating mask those are so awesome so the story of Aesop to me really tells of staying in your lane producing products that are high quality and regardless of Trends in popularity doing what feels right to you because if it's truly something good that will speak for itself and this is a metaphor that we can apply to just about everything from people around us to situations we face and everything that we interact with like our favorite products hope you guys enjoyed this episode and if you like this format let us know what you would like to see below give it a like give it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my3995xZZ84,uh this is a lip balm with cedar and citrus lip uh salt has grapefruit grind cedar atlas orange rind and uh from let me see ingredients ingredients ingredients it has orange oil it has grapefruit peel oil castor seed oil cedarwood bark oil so is our cream so a lot of the ingredients in issa are like interacting in between in between the products because well the whole brand is using one concept of natural ingredients in them so this is the lip balm it tastes very good uh it is super silky uh it's like super food for your lips i am going to fly a little and you'll see that as a bomb it is very silky as i said before very glossy so it's not like it's not your typical um chapstick it's like a little gel that is so good stays on your lips for some time uh it doesn't have much to ascend but it tastes um delicious not like you have to tease it but if it happens to be uh you know a little in your mouth on your tongue the tip of the tongue it smells so delicious so um i mean you don't see it like that it's not like probably super glossy if we are considering like the lip balms but it is glossy uh and i'm using it on top of chapstick or sometimes just this for the night um which is so good because it stays on the lips on the lips for longer and really infusing it with all the moisture so you're waking up with such soft lips it's amazing so this guy is only 16 which is 19 but right now for you sixteen dollars and uh i'm probably gonna need to reorder because i've been using it for a long time and for a lot a lot of times it's amazing citrusy it's really like orange peel on my lips so good and um yeah this one is amazing like it's in my um daily use i love it love it love it so much so highly recommend it too and another another product that i want to show you guys would be the rose water um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJMYamxOtMo,you know i mean this is one of those amazing products that i kid you not they're it's just a must-have for me you know people get weirded out especially with aesop's yep um danielle asap are the fragrances natural yes they are natural which is great um they're also vegan and cruelty free so there's that aspect too um the back to the fabulous facial oil um it's one of those products that really does add a glow i like to be glowy but there's a difference between looking glowy and too oily um so with this especially if you're using it during the summer i would probably recommend using one to two drops like after you use the hydrosol and after use the primrose hydrating cream a little tip that i learned from one of my esthetician friends is that because you know oil is thicker than water and also some of these creams that you're using you really want to use it as a last kind of thing to seal the moisture between your skin um and that'll make sure that your skin is hydrated throughout the day and you're still looking dewy and glowy which is amazing um so with this fabulous facial oil there's univerberry there's ylang ylang there's jasmine petal so the scent profile for this is very very floral um a little bit herbaceous but i would not say that it's earthy but if you're into aromatherapy what i normally love to do i'm gonna grab or drop three drops there and warm it with my hands and just like inhale and you really get the sense of the yelling yelling and and the unifor berry which are just so calming and uplifting and then i just pat it onto my face and gently underneath the eye area because it's very sensitive it's a very fragile area and voila and even on the neck because again other parts of the body are super important but i'm wearing a shirt so you know get it all over the place and even the back of the neck i feel like you can get lines i mean you you definitely have seen it especially when you're on vacation people have lines in the back of their neck because they don't moisturize they don't use sunblock that's another thing that we'll get into make sure you make sure that you add like some mineral spf not just like the spray on stuff because if you don't have like zinc in your spf especially if you're on the sun you're not actually blocking uv rays so uv rays are super super harmful they'll expedite aging process with your skin um so i highly recommend really ending on that and don't forget like a little eye cream underneath um your eyes but sadly i don't have any from a socks so um i'll just use a different kind of eye cream normally like this brand called fresh because i feel like they're in alignment with aesop's mission of just using natural not natural elevated products um but does anyone have any questions so far i mean if you can see that my skin is very dewy right now i feel like i'm more glossy because i honestly just showered and then i already used the products earlier um so what i would do if i feel like i'm too glossy or too dewy i'd grab a cotton round again and just pat or it's too you know shiny or too like glowy and normally that's my t-zone so this is your t-zone right here your nose your forehead luckily my hair hides it but sometimes i get it right here if you can see where my cheekbone is but it also adds like a little natural highlight so i would never um i don't know i don't think that blotting this area is super important because it's a little pop up here your your cheekbone um so yeah those are the amazing products that i would use on the daily um again if you're just joining me now it's immediate moisture facial hydrosol it has amazing botanicals like rose petal and chamomile to keep you hydrated and um and uh and chill you know because the chamomile is definitely a relaxing um herb it's a relaxing plant so again it's a great size for your purse if you're on the go and you need a little uplift so just spray it smells great the scent doesn't stay there for long which is nice i would probably say it stays for five minutes um but it is great to have that kind of aromatherapy kind of like little action especially if you're in a car if you're an uber or something like that or on a plane i mean travel is happening soon so or people are traveling which is nice i know i am and then again the primrose facial hydrating cream this is a great cream for all seasons um but if you're like again if you're using it in the summer really do not double down like go lighter in the amount that you would use because a little bit goes a long way it has sage rosemary and lavender stern which are all very hydrating again the central file for this is more earthy less florally which is nice it's beautiful it comes in this great alchemist kind of container with the brown glass as do all of asap products which is great if you wanted to take a cute selfie or shelfie of your products um and then also what i love about asap products is that everything is listed on there so the ingredients the concerns um and also the packaging is just so beautiful again i just got in the sucker for really great marketing but it's also great when a product works as well and looks good too so kudos to you asap we love you so much next again uh it's the fabulous facial oil which is amazing it's made with ylang ylang berry and also jasmine petals so again the scent profile here is very very um it's very florally uh which is nice i mean some folks may say that it's too it's too florally but again the scents don't last that long which is nice because you'll probably add makeup on top or finish it off with your sunscreen and your eye cream and all that jazz but i i don't know i love the sense that i don't think that they're too overpowering and i love aromatherapy too so what i normally do again is i'll make a moist i'll like rub it into my hands and then i'll warm it up to make sure that the oil is easier to you know manipulate or use and inhale it which is nice you get the yellow angling and the petals and all that stuff and then just quickly dab all over my face to seal the moisture from the hydrosol and the primrose um facial cream so that's more or less like my my summer skincare routine aside from a nice eye cream and really finishing off with a mineral zinc sunblock or sunscreen it's really really really really really important to have zinc or some sort of mineral in your sunscreen to make sure that you're blocking out harmful uv rays because you know those uv rays will exfoliate the aging process of your skin and also you know i mean make you susceptible to things like skin cancer and whatnot but again i'm not a dermatologist i just have tried so many different products um i know what works for me which is something that i definitely stress all of my viewers and friends to do is just to really just try a product for yourself um and luckily we have these great deals that are happening on their shop because you're getting these products that are you know for full price it's heavily discounted you know if you get it today you can get 30 off of beauty um by checking out via

what do you guys normally use on your skin um for the summer you know it's it's such a crazy time especially i feel like in new york where it gets super humid right now there's a tropical storm ahead to us so um it's one of those things where i feel like i'm either um i'm either blotting or i'm just like staying indoors because i really don't want to deal with the weather but luckily i'm getting to see my family in hawaii next month and then also california and then a couple of weddings which is nice so i'm really excited to just you know be out there be around people and and just chill and have that human interaction so i mean if you're just joining us right now i'm gonna the products are frozen there we go let's i'm just gonna show you what we're discussing we were discussing the immediate moisture facial hydrosol which is a great great very great hydrosol that really just hydrates your skin it's very nourishing it's very calming at the same time with chamomile and rose petal it is great for on the go um and this lovely lovely travel size bottle which is just phenomenal i i feel like i go through a bottle maybe every two weeks because it really does add a little pep to my skincare routine especially for fatigued or tired skin so you just spray it around which is nice and don't forget your decollete which is here your shoulders and all that which is amazing um again skincare is not just your face it's your entire body so don't forget your neck because you don't want tech neck um or lines um because if your skin is dry you're prone to get lines and you know no one really wants the fine lines under their eyes or on their neck or anything like that so just make sure that you're hydrated hydrated topically and internally don't forget to drink lots of water that's again that's another skincare hack i hope it's not a hack for you um because dehydrated skin will not have that elasticity um and you know if the collagen product production will probably not be at a hundred percent if your skin or your body can't nourish itself or get nutrients to your entire body so don't forget to hydrate by drinking water drink electrolytes too because uh they'll make people good and will give you the extra added energy i know i always feel like i'm deficient especially when i'm um back home because it's always so hot and you're also you're always so sweaty so um and then next we have the primrose facial hydrating cream which is nice because again again it's like an all-around cream if you're using it in the winter i would use a teaspoon amount because it is so thick and nourishing you can even use it as a hydrating mask so if you see here it is the viscosity is just so thick i mean you can't even like shake it which is great um and if you have combination skin like myself it's just it's just phenomenal especially in keeping me hydrated and making sure that um you know my makeup or foundation doesn't look cakey or you know cracky because no one wants that um i'm gonna use this side because i already hydrated that side you can see it is just like a thick cream and it'll add a little like bounce not balance a little plump it'll plump my skin which is nice underneath the jawline and then down snag i'm not doing the other side because we already did that and yeah there we go and see it's already like super hydrated it adds that little glowy glow that you have here which is nice um again if you feel like you're too dewy you can mat yourself or use some setting powder to really just absorb the excess dew um so i would definitely do that which is always just a little hack because i don't know it's better to be hydrated than not and then to finish i would use the facial the fabulous face oil which is just a great product it's very very floraly which is nice especially if you believe in um aromatherapy like myself so we have uniprovera yulang ylang and jasmine petal again the bottles are so cute which is nice it's the perfect kind of item to fit in your purse make sure it's very very tight so you don't have any accidents especially if you're putting it in a nice bag um my little hack after i've used the hydrosol and the primrose hydrating cream is to seal everything not really seal um to create like a barrier on your skin to really lock in the moisture some of my dermatologist friends have told me that which is always nice to have folks that work within the skincare industry um yeah it's just a it's a clear oil you can see there putting it on my skin and it smells great a little bit of aromatherapy if you wanted to again what i normally do is just warm it up with my hands and inhale and then exhale because we're always so so stressed yes aaron um come to new york you can meet all of my my dermatologist friends and then we can also have coffee too um but this fabulous facial oil really does make me feel fabulous because it provides a lovely glow it nourishes my skin it even nourishes my soul i might say um but yeah does anyone have any questions i mean i know we have about eight minutes but if you know we aren't if everyone's pretty quiet and all that stuff my skincare routine for the summer is just super super simple and again really working and trying out new things for your skin i'm not a dermatologist myself but i know it works for me because i've tried so many different things don't forget to really look at labels and really understand if you have any allergies see a dermatologist or local dermatologist but also do your own research too because it's great to have multiple opinions i forgot to mention if folks have just tuned in recently that i love these three products and after after i use all of them i normally finish with an eye cream and then as some mineral sunblock um because it prevents it protects you from the sun which is nice so um thank you so much for tuning in don't forget about these amazing great deals that we have on their shop we have 25 off of all fashion full priced so make sure you jump on that deal especially if you're going anywhere for the summer because you know you'll have some you probably need some really cute bikinis or or trousers linen trousers at that to really just keep you styling on the islands or whatnot um and then 15 off of beauty and 15 off of beauty again if you check out during my live um so and and you get 30 minutes after this live to buy some things if you would like to but you know no pressure because because veroshop just has so many great deals going on which is very very nice um tune in next week uh the theme of my life will is still tbd but you'll see me on tuesday so drop me a note or any kind of comments or anything that if you have any questions i'm here for you i hope you have a lovely rest of your week and thanks so much for tuning in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YfIfQhMKA,please let's talk about this from aesop this is their resurrection aromatique hand balm obsessed love love love this is brand new i haven't even opened it yet um but we can totally do that right now um let me just pull up the deets on this because the aesthetic is just gorgeous aesop i love you forever the aesthetic is just so so nice for the packaging it's really really wonderful it says here that this is a blend of fragrant botanicals and skin softening emollients that delivers rich hydration to weathered hands and cuticles now although i haven't opened this one up yet i have used this in the past which is why i ordered it again off of their shop this is what the closure looks like when you first get it home and what you'll have to do is take off the cap and kind of just push that in once it's once it's pushed in then you're ready to go and let me tell you guys something it is the smell and the packaging for me i mean this just smells so lovely it kind of has the fragrance of it kind of has like a banella laced with like citrusy scent it's really nice and it oh my gosh it just smells fresh and kind of um healing and kind of like almost like aromatherapy so i really like this one a lot when i had it before i used to keep it in my bag right my travel bag because wherever you're traveling to you want to make sure that you're traveling and like your hands are not ashy just saying right like let's just baseline the conversation there like you want to make sure that your hands are hydrated and they look good you know i also used to keep this in my car with me when i drove because i just felt like i would always notice my hands when i was driving especially now like postcovid people's hands are a mess you know the alcohol and all that um all of that what is it called the alcohol sanitizer like it has really done some damage to our hands our fingernails our cuticles and now it's time to really start to take care of them again and replenish all of those good ingredients back into the skin so if you look at my hands now look how hydrated and just clean and beautiful they look like one thing that i also like about this particular um lotion is that it's not greasy you know which is a great thing there's nothing worse than having like greasy hands because you have to continue to touch things and then you dirty up things and then your hands get dirty and then it's just a cycle of like nastiness right so not with this product it feels really really nice and it goes into the skin immediately so i love that and i highly recommend it i'm going to show you the packaging one last time for it it's aluminum packaging as well so when it's done you just recycle it and you're good to go perfect so i hope you enjoyed your time with me today i'm gonna pop these off and let you see the final reveal of hydrated under eyes you deserve it and so do i yes i'm so glad that you joined me today for this live i hope that you will join me tomorrow i will be back again at 11 30 a.m we're going to be discussing more fabulous finds that i found here on vera shop but we're going to be discussing a clothing haul clothing if you love clothing please let me know definitely follow me here on the vera shop app i'm at tiffbenson so that for you'll be notified for my next live which is at 11 30 tomorrow eastern standard time i'm really excited for that show and i'm also very excited for the shows to come i ordered some amazing things on this app and i think that i hoped that and i also think you will love them so until next time my friends um definitely follow me on instagram on ig at tiffbenson that's where i am when i'm not here doing lives on vera shop and i will catch you in the next one love you forever and i will see you tomorrow at 11 30 eastern standard time bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRF7StcOlDA,[Music] marrakech intense by aesop is this beautiful spice fragrance so the first note that i get the dominant note in this perfume is cardamom there's so much cardamom that bursts out of the top notes here it is so beautiful if you like cardamom you're going to love this fragrance it's got cardamom has this sort of um you know to me it's like lemony and peppery and green and bright um so that's what this kind of you know bursts open with there's a little bit of bergamot in here as well and some pettigreen which adds like a nice green bitterness right so then there's actually this beautiful heart of florals this is not a floral forward scent by any means it's just a kiss in the middle if you will but there's a little bit of rose and a little bit of jasmine so it kind of softens or rounds out those spicy edges is sort of how i think of it the base has sandalwood and cedarwood which gives it this nice kind of grounding earthiness so if you know the asop brand they're kind of known for being this very natural smelling brand so all of their products you can really detect the the different herbal notes that they're using um i love that about them i love that natural smelling like almost like i could have made it in my own home or something right so sort of like a picture like tease or um yeah like just a garden that you're walking through so i really get the naturalness in this fragrance what i really love about this too is it's a spice scent for all year round absolutely will work in the winter and the fall but i love marrakesh intense for the summer in fact the first time i bought a bottle of this which was years ago i actually bought it like i remember in the middle of the summer one of the hottest weeks i mean it must have been in triple digits and i smelled it and i tried a little on and i loved it so then i ended up getting a bottle of it and i wore it all summer and i remember thinking it had this complexity of the spice that made it more interesting than maybe just your typical fresh citrus you know hot weather scent that we think of but it also felt really refreshing very invigorating it didn't weigh me down or feel too heavy or like blankety if that makes sense because i feel like some of their fall winter scents don't necessarily work in spring and summer this one does so again beautiful spicy notes this is in their spice category for the most part could also be woody oriental category again touch of florals that soften it although it's very unisex so men and women can definitely wear this whatever you know whenever you're in the mood for some kind of you know cool spice notes i would say check this out it's really lovely it makes me sort of happy it kind of elevates my mood i feel very um i don't know invigorated when i smell this you just kind of want to like spray it all over and then you can walk into the sunshine and you'll feel great um so yeah check it out uh aesop mayor catch intense they we do carry a couple of their other perfumes as well which are beautiful but this one to me is um kind of the most interesting i also just love spice notes so if you like spice notes and you want to try something a little different a little refreshing really beautiful check out marrakech intense you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbiRkIVwQCU,hey everyone talking about rozu by Aesop the notes in this are rose shiso and kayak wood this is a nice fresh take on Rose smells more like a real fresh Rose in a garden next to some Woods than like the typical wearable fragrance version of Rose which can sometimes smell either like really powdery and old school or like cloyingly sweet to me at least here it's more delicate and welcoming and the shiso adds this really nice green feel to it it still smells very like luxurious and classy like there isn't like this isn't one of those like babyish style Rose scents either or something but it's just very well balanced 195 for a 50 milliliter unisexling slightly feminine but this is not one of those Rose scents that's super feminine or anything overall moderate longevity and low to moderate projection and a link in the description where you can check it out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEX1LGBgqgU,okay guys as promised i have my review for the three new esop other topias fragrances that you guys have been asking me to do yesterday i featured them in my haul video so today i've got my thoughts on these three fragrances they are let's see here karst we've got miraceti or mira keti and then we also have aramia if you want to find out about these three fragrances which just launched a couple months ago plus give you a ranking of all the esop fragrances in order from the bottom to the top then please stay tuned [Music] thanks so much for tuning in this is sebastian with smelling great fragrance reviews yes today i'm talking about esop fragrances other topias a brand new collection of fragrances which is a trio of fragrances inspired by spaces that blur the boundaries of real and unreal here and there either way very very unique concept interesting fragrances also very very pricey i feel like prices have gone up consistently from the very first launches of the fragrances from this house to last year when they launched rosu and then finally these uh three fragrances but either way i'll let you know all about these three fragrances but before i get to the fragrances if this is your first time tuning into the channel and you still haven't subscribed please do click the subscribe button below and also click the bell so that you'll be notified for future videos and giveaways before i move on with the fragrances how many of you are fans of esop not only the fragrances that i'm going to discuss with you but the previous fragrances and of course all of their skincare body care and every other product that they sell i first discovered them at barney's here and i started using their vetiver you know deodorant spray very very strong smell great smell loved it i used to wear it with you know fragrances that it would complement but i've moved on to some skin care but i've really enjoyed a lot of their fragrances in fact i have every single one of them here today and one thing i do want to mention that these fragrances are not beast mode i keep mentioning them but they have some really really great smelling fragrances so these other topias fragrances launched all together this year a couple months ago but every other fragrance had launched you know separately this is a collection called other topias and they are auto parfum concentration in fact all the fragrances are eau de parfum 50 ml bottles for 195 and the perfumer apparently for these and the previous fragrances is barnaby filian don't know anything about this perfumer except for the fact that he does some uh have some great fragrances and why don't we go ahead and start out with uh my least favorite of the three which happens to be karst and you know uh when i compare the three together it's the the last one out of the three new other topias fragrances but you know it does smell great but it has a marine quality metallic mineral equality uh to the smell but it features notes of juniper berry cumin sandalwood but in the end you know it's very aromatic it's very spicy it's also very very woody i think the entire collection seems woody for sure nothing is ultra floral although some do have some floral touches but they're very very woody spicy fragrances and they also tend to lean green and grassy as well this particular one has fresh qualities and also herbaceous qualities so it has growable touches lightly green as well but the marine metallic and minerally touches do kind of get in the way for me a little bit but it's a bearable get in the way kind of a thing you know it's not overly fishy which is something i hate when fragrances do go that way on me on my skin very very sensitive to it so even though this is all very spicy woody earthy and you know you know herbaceous is what i'm trying to say fresh and herbaceous it definitely has the marine touches it definitely has light metallic qualities and definitely has minerally touches and i get metallic touches all the time from juniper and fragrances it's something that comes up it's a very very shiny clean metallic-ness that appears in juniper fragrances so it's a given that it's uh here but it does have the mineraly earthiness and then of course the oceanic marines in here as well so karst you know i don't hate the fragrance like i hate other uh marine fragrances but again it's my least favorite of the three other topias fragrances anyway karst but here's where things get really really great miraceti and aramia were fighting neck and neck as far as which one i liked the most i first started really enjoying miraceti but then aramia came around the corner and really really you know excited me with how it smelled but let's go ahead and talk about mirosetti first mirosetti is known for labdanum ambret and styrax there's definitely muskiness here and lots of ambery smokiness as well and styrax kind of related to benzoin so there's some sweet touches but not necessarily overly sweet these are not sweet fragrances to me and again all of them are very very cohesive not only in the other topias but also in the other four fragrances from the past but this one definitely gets dark and resinous there's smoky touches here very very woody but spiciness pepperiness appears and loads of musk there is a little bit of an animalic muskiness in here and you know you're also dealing with earth and herbaceous qualities and very very light very light oceanic hints not too much but it's back there almost like maybe i'm getting ambergris and ambergris has its you know oceanic qualities or you know marine type touches so i'm getting that because it is a little animalic but in the end it's dark but also bright at the same time musky and also very very sexy and resinous and woody uh at the same time miraceti it was really really great as i said one that i thought was going to be my favorite from the other topias fragrances but turned out to be my second favorite but then we have aramia here and arami aremia or arimia aramia is what i'm going to say aramia is so so good guys amazing amazing fragrance but it does remind me a little bit of a fragrance from tom ford that i really loved it's um very a little bit not too much because of its greenness because this is ultra green and i love the greenness in this one it's almost like taking roses greenness and aromatic spicy woodiness and throwing away the rose touch and then you know adding uh more to it like citruses and some iris powdery touches but aramia features galbanum iris and nuzu as main notes so in the end though galbanum is bitter green kind of vegetal all prominent here uh it also there's a little bit of a floral touch in here but you know we're not dealing with white flowers we're not dealing with rose we're dealing with galvanum and iris mostly so iris has floral qualities but it's powdery it's kind of vegetal with the galvanum married together kind of um you know you know amplify amplifying its vegetal qualities and also if you know anything about chanel number 19 it has galvanum and iris this doesn't smell like number 19 whatsoever but the marriage is perfect with the galbanum note and the iris note so in the end it's got freshness lots of citrus freshness here light floral touches and then it's musking and ozonic a little bit as well but in the end green and vegetable and powdery delicious fragrance this one's really really great smells fantastic i keep wanting to smell it and i think it's a great job that they've done with that one uh and the thing with that one and all of these fragrances and i keep saying also these are not big bad ass fragrances they're not beast mode they're not whatsoever but there are some great great fragrances and and most consumers don't want these big fragrances unlike us frag heads who want fragrances that last and last and last and i think these are not made for uh people like well they are but unless you can get past the fact that they're not beast mode uh but you know if you like really really unique fragrances this this brand has them they kind of match their skin care and body care products and even that stuff smells amazing i i wish some of that stuff would be uh changed into actual fragrances but right now we've got seven fragrances with three just launched from the other topias collection so these are other topias fragrances uh again my favorite of the three is aramia miraceti is quite close behind it and then also karst is far behind it uh behind the two so let's talk about how i would rank the entire collection the entire collection i would put karst karst would be at the very very bottom uh this is number seven number seven because you know again it does have marine touches and i'm not the biggest fan but this is tolerable but when i'm ranking everything together it's uh at the bottom so that's number seven uh number six would be let's find it because these bottles all look very very similar number seven that's not it either is tacit so tacit is very citrusy and spicy i think it's the most simplistic fragrance in the collection but you know it does wear great and it smells great with the the spiciness the contrast it's almost like grapefruity because grapefruit to me is zingy spicy so it's almost like you've got lots of spicy grapefruit touches with that one so number three or number number three number five would be marrakesh intense marrakesh intense to me smells like soda cola spicy cola kind of a thing it's a really really great fragrance the least expensive out of the entire collection and i believe this is their first fragrance uh it smells great um uh just like a spicy um coca-cola or rc cola kind of a thing fun fragrance to wear uh and i like that kind of maybe um uh i don't i'm not saying it smells similar like leo desert maro kane but maybe similar ideas but i find marrakesh intense to be a little easier to wear than uh alert desert mario kane so next up is quill this one right here the very very popular fragrance um i actually was trying to buy bottles of these for a client who couldn't find any anywhere so apparently uh esop was uh in a major shortage with with this one i just recently went and bought one and turns out they are still in a shortage but they had some stock i don't know how true this shortage is but nobody had it uh even places like neiman's saks would say coming soon coming soon where this fragrance has been around for a while and wheel has been around quite a bit and i think it's the most popular fragrance in the collection i recently featured it in a video of fragrances i wish was more intense but this is incense woods and spices smoky cypress uh hinoki wood kind of a thing a great fragrance uh definitely a number four though uh then we've got miraceti mercetti at number three and we've already talked about this one it's the labdanum ambred stylex combo that uh is very resinous and musky so miraceti at number three uh let's see which one is next rozu rozu came out last year and i really like its rose touches and vegetal green crunchy stemmy touches lightly hinting at something like rose 31 but doesn't go there it doesn't get too dry and vetivery like this one has the light coumadin touches in there but it's more vegetal and green to me with the rose really a great fragrance my number two favorite and then of course my number one is aramia a remy is really really good it smells really great to me it reminds me a little bit also like there's a little um a licorice or anise in there like uzo like uh i said it reminded me of vertebois uh vertebrae featured this kind of like uzo accord and i'm kind of smelling it in here it's so good so so good so number one is uremia and those are my uh ranked list of isab fragrances what are your favorite fragrances from esop are you curious to discover the other topias fragrances because i know you guys have been asking me many messages i've received when are you going to review it when are you going to review it so here they are again i'm not going to get too detailed into the performance of these fragrances because all the time people say when i say it's beast mode they say oh it's weak on me when i say it's weak on me they say beast mode so i can't really tell people have all these different ideas personally to me these are great smelling fragrances very moderate in performance if anything is overwhelming i will mention it and if ever anything is overly weak i will mention it but i don't want to get into the details of you know moderate fragrances acting or performing moderately but either way let me know your thoughts on this house the other topias fragrances have you tried them do you like them do you like the sound of them or do you stay away from them because they're too expensive because they are a little expensive either way guys thanks so much for watching today's video if you have any questions or comments please list below please like this video please share it follow me on facebook twitter and instagram and i'll be back with more videos very soon have a good one goodbye [Music] you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJMld44nGQ4,is to you all here it's this lovely lovely lovely hydrating cream I just used it um on my face and I've been using this for about a month now it's a beautiful jar it probably has lasted me previous times because I love Aesop three four months depending on how you use it a little bit goes a long way it's made with rosemary Camellia nut um and sorry I forgot the other one Sandalwood um so they're all super super hydrating it's a little bit of an herbal scent but it goes away within 10 10 seconds I'd say but it is really nice if you're into aromatherapy like myself I'm going to test it out here for you the color is this lovely buttery color it's kind of on the thicker side so I again if you have combination skin oily skin I'd go a little bit lighter with the application um normally I'd probably use this much for my face and I just feel like it's the perfect amount especially during the summer time um I'm just gonna use it here I mean it just Blends right in it's super smooth super silky filled with vitamin E and other essential fatty acids that are great for the skin that can provide a little glow and a little bit of nourishment especially if you are on the drier side um or you're recovering from like being in the sun like myself so I love Aesop products because you know there are several stories everywhere and bearish Shop obviously stocks are great array and their selection is just on point especially with the discounts so I would definitely take advantage of that this is an essential that I pack with me because I want to stay hydrated especially during my travels um I tend to go to a lot of tropical places because you know my family's in Hawaii in California and I know California is not tropical but California is always 60 and sunny so um I just want to make sure that my skin is super hydrated during and after you know Sun Beach whatever um and also on the airplane you know because it's just recycled air your skin tends to get dry dried out and you know dry skin leads to premature aging and we don't want to look older than we are so um I definitely would recommend the chameleon that facial hydrating cream by ASAP it's one of my favorites it's just amazing and it's a great base if you're going to use some makeup or just want to make sure that you're going you know bare-faced hydrated and having that little glow it's not for very I'm very sharp it's 42.50 if you check out during my live you'll get an additional 15 off so there's that think about it a little bit and the next product that we have

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcj_JhWmZVU,uh okay so this is from Aesop and I've always been nervous that I don't pronounce the brand correctly so let me know if I don't but I'm pretty sure I do um guys this hand bomb is the bomb I'm obsessed with this hand bomb it is absolutely incredible it smells fantastic um I'm usually very weary about um hand creams and just any kind of creams in general for my body as well because I don't like that really sticky feeling um it's very very humid in Miami it's usually you know just you walk out and you already feel like you're drenched in sweat so there's no worse feeling than applying a bunch of cream on your body or even your hands and then walking outside and it just feels like you took a shower or you've been you know running a marathon so I was initially nervous about this because I thought it might be just another hand cream but I had actually tried a sample at um I think it might have been Nordstrom or I think I actually went into the actual there's an Aesop shop here in Miami and I had walked in and by the way it smells incredible in there but I had walked in there and I remember trying this and it was incredible I remember feeling so good like my hands felt so refreshed and they didn't feel sticky at all because what happens is that obviously initially when you first apply it you feel that like cream feeling but then it soaks into your skin so it leaves your hands hydrated but you don't feel like they're like clammy or sticky or you know you're gonna touch something and leave a mark so this is kind of how it comes out you do have to be really careful because I was saying this last week these kinds of um this kind of packaging um if you squeeze it too hard a lot of it comes out like you barely have to press this for any product to come out of it um so aside from that a little bit goes a very very long way like you saw how little I put on here it's really not that much and then you just like rub it into your hands obviously again like everything about me is very small so I have very small hands so obviously I don't require as much product but even if for someone who has bigger hands I wouldn't see you needing much more product than I just applied so sometimes I'll even like apply into like my forearms my wrists and I'll kind of you know if I have if I especially if I've added a little bit too much product I have enough to like go down and it just feels incredible like right now there's that very little like feeling of like cream and I promise you in about a minute or so that will completely dissolve and go into my skin so and then you can see here like now my skin is like hydrated um so yeah that was the next one oh and it smells like um well it has Mandarin Rosemary and Cedar it smells kind of like when you peel an orange or something citrusy and then it has that little extra cake of that like musky smell I love it um okay the next thing is I feel like I am how am I already running out of time um I'll keep this every week guys I I don't know how I'm running out of time but okay I'm gonna show you this this next thing these are Levi jeans so let me present them to you right now uh I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCodfprFLZ0,[Music] all right so both of new products I've been pretty lazy with chain care I mean I really like I use tech bill or see the bill I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it right but I really like this product like I love it it's cheap you can get it from CVS or Walgreens and it works it like my skin the most part has been pretty clear and there I'll get like you know I'll get a pimple or something like that but what's gonna is free even I don't know I don't use a toner but I do get facials but honestly since Colgate 19 it has now been March April May yeah so it's been at least four months since I've gotten a facial and when my skin has been best typically like honestly for the past year before that I was getting facials once a month and for those of you who don't know like what a facial is it's just like you know it's kind of like a exfoliation extraction is actually not that it's like it seems like it's gonna feel like super good but it actually hurts because I just like come in and just like basically cleaning out your skin completely but it works it really really works so I highly recommend getting facials like at least you know every few months just to give yourself a deep cleanse for your skin yeah yeah but once a once a day about once a month sometimes every two months but at least once a month I was getting a facial and I think that for the most part really helped transform my skin and just help me help get my skin even so even now it's been I guess it's been about four months and all I'm doing now is I'm using set of doors as a Spencer day and night I am using this moisturizer I don't like this moisturizer or how it makes my skin feel so I'm not gonna give you guys the name of it but I am like literally like I've used a few to promote arises I'm not sticking to one so this isn't even like when I'm standing about I really like it but it's just one that I got and then this I do stand by it's a dry mass by Mario Badescu but I also think that this burned me and I'm not sure why but I start I don't know if it's because I've been starred so much during the pandemic and not getting as much Sun but my skin has been really sensitive lately and that's part of me wanting to change my whole the skincare routine up because yeah I've been going through some changes so no that's it the most part I don't really have too much issues too much cannot feel like it's pretty even don't have that many breakouts yeah I do just want to change it up like I want to have like this is my routine these are some nice products so what that's it I am now going to start using adopt butter I got three of their products I've used their stuff before and I really liked it I really like them they're all-natural okay so they say so it's opportunit their products aren't are Mastro but they do use some time based things but they also believe in science or they're using something to enhance all of their stories and stories are beautiful I also love the products I'm using before this fell amazing you're just not cheap like the packaging I got three Publix I got the parsley the Parsee see facial cleanser and I got this one because especially it has like a lactic acid exfoliation okay so I got the first to see facial cleanser this is 3.4 ounces and this was quite $43 for this bottle and then I also got to be in be talents and toner and I only got this one because they didn't have the parsley seed toner because I wanted to do all parts to see products but they didn't have that one so I got the B&B I think that's why I got to go B&T he appreciates what I got that one so then this one is $35 for the toner and then I also got the Parsee seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream so this is the only one moisturizing so I want to start using a toner again and just try that out like I haven't been using a toner and I guess everyone's gonna has been fine but I'm gonna see just because I feel like I would like yeah like what's gonna be cleaner I'm starting to see now that I'm not getting facials I am starting to get you know little bumps to blackheads here and there so all in all this whole package and then they gave me free shipping but the deadly to me with Texas was a hundred sixty seven dollars so one hundred fifty seven dollars for your skincare routine let's see how long these products last meet is June the 10th so I'm gonna see how long these products last me I'm gonna see the difference that they make on my skin hopefully it does make a huge difference or just for me since like I said I am not upset at my skin I would like you to just be better or at maintain but I would love to see what investing in something like I just a cinnamon routine because I KY said I've been keeping it just pretty lazy with just a set of feel and just like whatever kind of moisturizer for me I really just want a good moisturizer than I really like and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna love this one cuz I think I've tried it before yeah who knows maybe I go from maybe I really like the cleanser or and I don't need a toner so I'm gonna end then just you know going back to the set of field and then keeping the moisturizer we'll see Sophia I just want to share that with you guys so these are going to be my new facial products and I'll keep you guys posted on how it goes [Music] [Music] okay so we're going to start with the bishop [Music] [Music] okay I thought nice those really good smells amazing like that's definitely from the set up there like that's just nice like I think I look forward to using this every morning for sure a kid so that's that now so I was I got so premium cut around so that I can use it on our way things that I have been using this on ladies but I have any class but I do feel like my skin hasn't been as clean as I would like it to be I have seen a house everything was hideous from just using its honor like I would have [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it looks really clean all right so this is going to be day one of me using the a sub products when to log I think I'm gonna try to do like a 30-day thing and see if there's a huge difference but this is day one and yeah like I said I'm not that mad at my skin all really my skin is pretty pretty much fine we'll see how my skin does with a proper overnight in de woods and I might try some other things like some eyes yeah sometimes I use all of their products all right I'm headed to a casting real quick and the city will in Culver City so but a smoothie this morning that was really good science already all right absolutely still inside me like Charles Fischetti it's not like she already had like a good virtual casting of them so actually and wearing their shirt right now but yeah have you try other stuff see like this don't entice and that stuff makes me like I'll be one in two pieces [Music] hey how's it going for cheedo waste machos [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Xdox_exVQ,which is the gel cleanser for combination skin so if you have oily skin or oily and dry or dry it is perfect for you esa beautiful again australia base brand australia good brands um beautiful amber bottle we love issa for its packaging again more sustainable sustainability checked now let's open it you can order a pump separately for the bottles like that uh but again you don't have to because it is gel so you can control the amount you're going to use which is a little enough and again i'm gonna put it on my face and then we're gonna go straight to ingredients it's a deal let's wet it a little and let's as you can see the makeup is being removed even faster this is a gel here we are let me hold it for you guys super fast uh makeup removal and cleanser as well not necessarily to have makeup on your face um ooh it also like feels like uh if you ever tried a sub toner it feels like there are natural active ingredients salicylic acid here we are i feel the i feel the action of that already uh so here we are beautifully applied it is a gel cleanser for combination skin into minds their form formula give me just one second makeup removes super super fast one two again as a removable process of the cleanser itself super fast super fast three strokes and you're good no makeup detected beautifully and uh strips away the dirt layer of dirt uh cleaning your pores as well so this is oh i can read the ingredients for you here guys so we don't have to switch uh water thank you lavender oil ah coconut acid sage oil rosemary oil rosemary leaf oil citric acid salicylic acid as we said before witch hazel oil beautifully done again vegan and cruelty free uh into minds cleanser here we are so let's see let's wait like a minute i feel like this one uh is more like for oily skin because it really does the job of removing oils out of my face even more than um than the cream cream formula of grown alchemist so definitely definitely recommend it for combination skin and oily skin i think this is a must-have and also also does super super super great job with the makeup we just saw it was super fast super clean stripped away the makeup strips away the dirt and your face is prepared for the next step so this bottle is 100 milliliters they don't have a picture here before some reason but this is how it looks like our beautiful esa packaging 100 milliliters bottle and only 28 dollars and little goes long way uh i have been having it for well the whole summer what was it two months and um you know i've been using it time and time and i'm still like you know at the top of the bottle so beautiful products into mines for combination skin if some part parts of partially your skin is dry partially oily uh it is a beautiful beautiful beautiful thing to have and also helps with oily skin as well so as a fast makeup removal if you would like to use it like that and fit fast fist fast cleanser as well uh salicylic acid thank you with hazel sage leaf beautiful all the ingredients to have in the cleanser and for your skin let's move on let's move on let's move on to the third cleanser and i'm going to come back to two of them right here which was grown alchemist or cream cleanser for dry skin orientation for the dry skin obviously you can use it if you have combination skin but i would recommend it more for the dry skin because this creamy formula is super beautiful super gentle on your face um feels creamy let me show you again feels creamy light to wash it away you really just need three strokes with uh your wet hand this is the cream formula perfection dry skin will be so satisfied removes the makeup as we just saw no matter you wear makeup or not removes the dirt removes the dust and generally prepares your skin for all other steps of the routine and uh reduces the chances of you getting any acnes or blemishes or um in general any bacteria that you know exposes us to breakouts so the next one was which still is on a screen into mine's cleanser from esop which is for combination skin and it definitely feels like it strips away more oil than the creamy formula which um two parts of my face which i used um cream grown alchemist on this part of my face and uh gel is up cleanser on this one this one feels just a tiny bit feels like the more of the oils were stripped away which is would be amazing for combination skin and oily skin in general and the makeup uh was removed even faster but uh both both done incredible job so this one this this was our second cleanser from esop 100 milliliters so you can get for 28 only right now and a little goes long way as you saw we only needed just a tiny bit of that which again it doesn't have a pump but it's gel so you can control uh how much you use so and if you are completely uncomfortable with that you definitely can get a pump separately for all your esop products but um it doesn't you know it doesn't matter to me um you know less plastic the better so definitely definitely in love with these products and let's review that hello let's review the third one which would be to exist charcoal cleanser which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3rCnkygphQ,and uh cream is so great it smells like a mandarin orange i've actually used it before i've used a sample and it comes in one of those big bottles so like 42 bucks is pretty good for like a big bottle that's gonna last you a while um so that's great and what else okay so ghost democracy is a brand that i keep hearing everything about like i don't know if you guys have ever seen skincare by hiram he's on tick tock and he always mentions this line because it's super super clean like there are only a few ingredients i don't have the moisturizer with with me here i'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZc2gO9hvac,[Music] and welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new here hi my name is roma and welcome so before we get started i'd like to invite you guys to hit that subscribe button as well as the notification bell that way you can get notified every time i upload a new video also if you're feeling extra nice today please don't forget to give me a thumbs up before exiting out this video thank you so for today's video i am actually going to do a quick review concerning the aesop skincare products that i have unboxed a few weeks ago so if you want to see the unboxing i'm going to put a card just right up there and you are free to check it out so i'm going to show you what are the different products that i'm going to talk about in this video so the different products are i have the reverence aromatic hand wash in 500 ml as well as the reverence aromatic hand balm in 500 ml as well and then i'm going to talk about the damask and rose facial treatment and what are we actually using this for followed by the resurrection rings free hand wash that we actually receive as a tester and then i'm going to talk to you about the resurrection aromatic hanbong in the tube packaging and then lastly i'm going to talk about the rose hip seed lip cream also in the small tube so before we go directly to the review i'm just going to give you some information concerning aesop so asap was actually established in 1987 and they are headquartered in melbourne australia just to let you know their objective has always been to formulate skin hair and body care products of the finest quality indeed all asap products are vegan and they do not test their formulations or ingredients on animals so without further ado let's go to the review so first and foremost those products that i've just showed you arrive in two bags so this is the small bag that the small items that i have showed you came from and then those two big bottles came from this big [Music] i think it's a cotton dust bag so it's very very nicely presented very aesthetic so i'm going to start by a backstory concerning aesop my husband and i went there so i'm going to put the card just right up there so you can check it out when we went there and how it went as well so we went there for two main reasons first reason is concerning my dry skin that's one thing and then the second thing is for the damaged hands of my husband because as you all know with the current situation every time you go into a shop you have to put some gel or disinfectant on your hands and due to that of course some disinfectants are not that good on the skin and that's why it kind of damaged his skin not only it dried up but it damaged as well so that's why we went to asap because we heard a lot of good things about the product so we were like okay let's try and check it out so when we went there we talked to the um sales associate associates so the sa and we mentioned to her the different things that we are looking for so we've mentioned to her my dry skin and then we also mentioned her my husband's dry skin but most especially his damaged skin so he showed his skin it was really very red and it has some cracks already so the thing that she told us is of course the most important thing is to have a very good hydrating lotion but before putting a lotion you have to wash your hands first so that's why she actually advises to pick up the reverence aromatic hand wash in combination to the reference aromatic handball so these two are actually a pair that cleanse and hydrate the hard working hands so that's what they tell on the on the website so both of this are actually vetiver roots petigra and bergamot rind so for the hand wash it exfoliate so it's an exfoliating hand wash with finely milled pumice to gently scrub the hands it it is enhanced with petite extract and virgo material to ensure scrupulously clean hands and then afterwards with the hand warm this one is very rich readily absorb moisture moisturizing bone to soothe and treat labor weared hands so it is characterized by its complexed woody aroma and enhanced with skin softening potassium lactate and carefully selected emollients to affect sustained hydration so in short this too indeed has a woody aroma why because it's vetiver roots and also bergamot rain so those are really rooty things so very woody so kind of like sandalwood you know smell so i'm going to show you first of all the hanged wash so i'm just going to pump here just a second and then you will see i hope that you will be able to see on the camera so as you can see there are some little finely milled premise which is um the ingredients that kind of scrub your hands so that's why she um advice us this hand wash because not only it um cleanse your hands but it also um scrub the hands so it scrub actually all the dead skin so it's very good for all of those um all the dry skin that we have so it's it scrubs it so that is the first thing that we do we wash our hands with the reverence aromatic hand wash and then after we washed it we use the um reverence aromatic hand bone as i mentioned earlier this is mainly mostly for those who have the uh labor word hand so um for me i just have a dry skin so i can use another um kind of hand balm i'm going to show it to you afterwards what kind of hand belt i'm actually using and this is mainly for those who have really damaged skin so that's why she proposed this combo so this duet for my husband and in addition to that so for the price i'm going to put the price just right down here that's the current fries in february 2021 and with that she also recommended to use the damascus rose facial treatment so normally this product is for like it mentioned facial treatment so it's a concentrated blend of precious plant extracts delivering potent doses of vitamins and fatty acids so it relieves nourishes and replenishes parched skin so it's actually suited for normal dry to extremely dry and distressed skin so once you use this you this you feel in your skin that it's supple and it is nourished with a sustained finish so the key ingredients are rose petal neroli blossom and also a violet leaf so normally this is used for your face but it's also very good for the hands so what my husband do is he washes hands so after we wash his hands he put the um the hand bomb and then he mix it with two drops of the damascus rose so um why two drops because the price of this this is 25 milliliter it costs 63 euros it's quite expensive but yeah um so he just put two drops especially when he feels that his hand is very dry and very damaged so i'm going to show you just with one drops how it looks like to be honest i never really use this because it's mainly it is my husband who uses this so just one drop as you can see but he told me that i can use it also for my face if i want to because it's really as you can see it's very oily but it penetrates the skin immediately so for those of you who are really have some very dry skin or damaged skin yeah he well he's been using this since i made the unboxing so quite a while and ever since he showed me his hands afterwards and he doesn't have any of those redness anymore or cracks so he used this at least minimum once a day so before going to bed specifically so he wash his hands put his cream and put two drops of the masculine rose facial treatment and it smelled quite well as well so he did that every night before going to bed and then since his hands are doing well from time to time he also uses it um during the day when let's say if he really feels that it's quite you know um his hand is very he started to have some crack on it he used one drop and yeah and it it suited his skin so now i'm going to talk about the resurrection rinse free hand wash so like i've mentioned earlier we have received a tester so very nice of the sales associate by giving us a tester and normally this one the 50 i think this is the 50 ml yeah the 50 ml cost 9 euros so it's not that expensive and it also exists in 500 ml if you want and i think that is a 39 euros so this one she gave us a tester because like i mentioned earlier yeah you know when we go to different childhood obliges or they ask us to put the gel the disinfectant and so on and because of that it damages our skin that's why she gave us this so that every time we enter a shop we can show them that we have one that we're going to use ours instead of theirs so very nice of her so the resurrection rings free hand wash it's a non-drying alcohol-based formulation with purifying and hydrating properties it is to cleanse hands effectively when fresh water is actually unavailable so the perfect pocket-sized product to ensure perpetually clean hands so the korean regions are mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas and the aroma is citrusy woody herbaceous and um the skin feel of this is clean fresh non-sticky and non-drying so i'm just going to show you a little goes a long way to be honest i don't know if you can see it nice i hope so and it is really yeah oh if you can smell it my gosh so so so nice [Music] yeah i can really smell the the mandarin um print as a as a first smell so um very nice and we have used it quite a while now and to be honest it doesn't dry our hands at all so very good problem so now i'm going to talk about the resurrection aromatic hand bone so this one in 75 milliliters which costs 25 euros and this product is a blend of fragrant botanicals and skin softening emollients that delivers rich hydration to label worried hands and cuticles so when you use this product it has a skin feel of nourish supple with a greaseless finish the aroma is citrus woody and herbaceous and the key ingredients are mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas so this product is a very very popular product from the asap line as well you can see this product everywhere on instagram as well as every time you watch the what's in my bag you can always see this product most especially on the what's in my bag for korean ladies out there they always have this product in their handbag so i will show you how it looks like so it's going to be honest this product a little goes a long way so just going to show you so it's quite yellowish but it's very very it's creamy and it immediately goes in your skin it has a a scent of very like you've mentioned very citrusy a little bit of woody but mainly citrusy and it's i think it's the mandarin rinse and it is really nice to the filling ah and it's also like i mentioned it's also good for your cuticles especially me who has bad cuticles so yeah that's for the resurrection aromatic handball so now i'm going to talk to you about the rose hip seed lip cream in this small tube so it's a six milliliter tube and this one costs 13 euros and this is actually a vitamin rich blend formulated to replenish soften and hydrate the delicate and sensitive skin of the lips it is formulated free from silicone and paraffin so this one is suited for dry lips in need of softening the skin feel is hydrated and conditioned with a non-greasy finish the key ingredients are rose hip seed tocopherol and ilan so i'm going to show you how it looks like so as you can see oh it comes up that's the only let's say minor things that i didn't like about this it's it's really oozing out so just be careful but other than that it is really really creamy and very very hydrating as you can see um it has a slight smell mainly the rose hip yeah it's the smell of rose hip but the fragrance is not that powerful so it's also okay and when i use it on my lips it's really really hydrating and soft the only thing as well is since this is a tube you need to use your fingers to put it on your lips so be sure to have clean hands before using this product so to summarize my review of the asap skincare products we have been using it for a few weeks now and with the results that we are getting most especially for the hands because those are the ones that uh we are really using daily so for the reverence hand wash and hand balm it really cleanses my hands it really scrubbed and take off the dry skin and then afterwards putting the reverend's hand balm it really um hydrates the skin and then for my husband the fact that he is also using the damascus and rose facial treatment for his hands really helped treat his damaged skin and then other than that the resurrection wins free hand wash in combination with the resurrection aromatic hand balm is really good especially when we are outdoors and also with my dry lips i'm really really enjoying using the rose hip seed lip cream it hydrates my lips so there you go that's my review concerning the ace of skin care products i highly well my husband and i we highly recommend these products for using them just a few weeks and having great results already we recommend them to you and don't hesitate to try them so if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to give me a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already and again thank you guys so much for watching this video and i'll see you on my next one take care bye [Music] mm-hmm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckQpjs-PmoI,hello and welcome to my youtube channel to skin care design today i want to introduce the esop resurrection aromatic hand to bar and here i want to give you a little review about the product and my honest opinion about the product so the bottle obviously looks fantastic looks really nice but i want to also give you an honest opinion about the product itself about the handball so the bottle costs around 70 pounds it's quite a lot 500 ml is a large bottle obviously it will last a long time but you have to make your own decision whether you want to spend 70 pounds for it or not um the product itself is actually quite thick okay it is quite thick um which is great um it also feeds quite oily in the skin um so you don't have to use a lot i used a little bit too much um so the skin doesn't absorb it quickly um your hands will actually stay a little bit um stay a little bit oily when you use the product so this is something you have to take into consideration as well whether you like it or not i personally prefer my hand balms or hand creams to absorb quickly because i don't like sticky fingers sticky oily hands but obviously the smell is amazing it smells so botanical it smells really luxurious and yeah obviously the mandarin rind makes it smell a little bit like lemon citrusy and the sitter a little bit woody at the same time which is amazing ingredients wise the ingredients are okay i would say and there are many oils essential oils lavender glycerin obviously water sweet almond also a more affordable oil is on the top of the list um so yeah i think i personally think the product is overpriced not gonna lie it definitely is overpriced but it looks obviously beautiful in the bathroom would i purchase it again i'm honestly not sure i think the price point is just a little bit ridiculous for handball so i would probably not purchase this specific product again if you've got any questions please let me know i hope you like my video thank you and please don't forget to give thumbs up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wqAgNdFDo&ab_channel=EmmaCaitlain,hey guys welcome back to my channel today i wanted to share with you a bunch of products that i picked up in a recent shop that i did at esop so it's a little bit of a haul because i was restocking a bunch of things around my home and the reason why i love these products and by the way these have all been bought with my own money they're not gifted i wish so the reason i really love them is because they're very aesthetic so they look really beautiful sitting around the house or displayed and i also am obsessed with their stores i think it's one of the best retail experiences because you kind of walk in they're all extremely unique and done by local designers which is something that is really cool for me being a designer myself and i think their product ethos is amazing there are a lot of natural ingredients they all smell beautiful the people in the store talk like this so you feel really calm and i just think it's amazing that they give you so many different samples and they've got anything from spf to skin care to just kind of little bits and pieces around the house so i'm going to show you through everything that i picked up and if you are new here just a super quick reminder don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and hit that subscribe button i put up new videos every single week now let's get into the first product my favorite product and i guess one that's a little bit on the cheaper side so if you were just kind of wanting it for aesthetic purposes then this is a really good place to start so that is the esop mouthwash so i'm not even going to try and pronounce it the way that they say it underneath but the flavors if you will in this is clove bud star anise and spearmint leaf this is so nice it's so so refreshing and it's not harsh like normal mouthwashes that i guess have a little bit of alcohol and things in it to really kill the bacteria this is more just like an oral hygiene kind of thing i think it's just like so you've always got fresh breath and i think the bottle is so beautiful it also did come with a little glass beaker on top but mine smashed unfortunately i think it was a little bit undersized for the bottle so definitely check that in the store before you take it home because the beaker would have been really nice and then it kind of covers like this plastic lid which is a little bit naff but i love this and i guess if you didn't want to be spending you know 25 or whatever on mouthwash you could probably just buy it once and then refill the bottle with whatever mouthwash you normally use so this is definitely one of my staple products and something that i honestly just keep going back and buying all the time the next product i really love from them and something that's really nice to have if you've got guests coming to stay and you want to put some little things on the end of their bed for them to have their own little products while they're staying with you is the cleansing bar so this is a body cleansing slab by esop and it is bergamot rind langlang and tahitian lime it smells so good and it really moisturizes your skin which i love so this is what it looks like it's literally just a baby soap bar and i just think this is so sweet it honestly it just smells amazing and i think it's a really really nice little gift to give to someone or just something really great to have in your shower because i know like often when you go to the shops and you buy a bar of soap it's enormous and i get that they're just trying to give you good value for money but i find if you leave a soap bar in the shower for too long it goes really manky and i end up wanting to throw it out which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a huge soap bar and having the big value in the first place so i really like this one because as you can see it's like smaller than the palm of my hand and i find that i actually just end up using and finishing the bar instead of wasting any of it the next product is also quite an affordable one from them and a definite essential given the whole situation we've just gone through this last year and that is hand sanitizer so i keep this one with me in my handbag and i also have one at work on my desk i hate really strong and harsh sanitizers i think you know when you go to the chemist or somewhere out and about and they ask you to sanitize your hands before walking into the store i have my own because i hate those ones that are super super strong and they almost like make your hands really dry as well i feel like my hands were just getting completely dried out after all of that so this one is called the resurrection rinse free hand wash and it's mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas whatever that is and it is an alcohol-based one as well so it is a proper hand sanitizer that will do the job and it just smells divine so this is another really great staple from esop so on the topic of dry hands that was something i really struggled with because i'm someone who loves to slather themselves in moisturizer so feeling like my hands were kind of getting attacked during the pandemic especially in winter which already ordinarily dries out your skin i wanted to get a hand balm so i got this one this is called the balm or balm aromatic and it just comes in this little tube which again you can just pop in your handbag so super convenient size it is the same kind of scents and ingredients as the hand sanitizer so it's mandarin rind rosemary leafs and cedar atlas and it's just a really amazing moisturizing hand balm i'll show you what some of it looks like sorry this is a new one so i've got to pierce the lid um but it's just this little yellow kind of colored um balm and it's quite thick without being like claggy i guess which is also really nice i don't like when you kind of put on hand bums and they're like i don't know a little bit too oily and stuff because then it sort of just feels a little bit gross and you end up wanting to wash it off now because i love that one so much i actually have it in the bigger size as well and this was initially bought because i just absolutely love the packaging of these tubes i've seen these things you can get where you can kind of like roll up the tube on a little metal thing um if you know where to buy those please let me know because i have no idea and it didn't come with one of those but that would be really really handy but like i said again it's the exact same ingredients this one is just the bigger size in this really cool looking tube and this is my one that i keep at home in my bathroom something that i use every single morning to wake me up before i go to the gym because i do a 6 a.m pilates class is this one and it's the immediate moisture facial hydrosol so this one is just like a little bit of a spritzing spray i guess if we were traveling i would definitely take this with me on the plane i feel like years ago when i was younger i would always just put on like a full face of makeup so i looked good on the plane and now these days i'm all about hydrating and moisturizing so i would be drinking a ton of water and putting on all of my skincare products and just making sure i arrive feeling really hydrated so this was something that i discovered a little while ago so this is rose petal bergamot peel and chamomile bud and it's an invigorating spray on hydration to relieve all skin types now i just love this i know but some people probably don't like the idea of being like spritzed in the face when you first wake up in the morning but for me i really like it and it's definitely um like a solid part of my morning routine i just really really enjoy it and i definitely feel like it wakes me up a little bit so i can get in the mood to work out now this is an old one and it has been floating around the bottom of my handbag so i aimed you to go and get it again and it's this lip balm so this is a really tiny little size one and it's kind of in a tube so this is a little bit um impractical i guess because it sort of just does this can you see what it's doing it's literally just like coming out of the tube so i probably will not buy this again because it does this every time and i have absolutely no idea why but it's so annoying and it weighs so much of the product but anyway this is called the rose hip c rose hip seed lip cream and it's rose hip seed to sephiral and langling and it's to hydrate your lips but i'm hoping that they've got one that's more just in like a i don't know like a little lip smacker looking kind of tube instead for lip balm because like i said that one was just a pretty bad purchase i think it would make a really cute gift but it's just not practical something i am definitely on board with now and i never used to be really good at using is spf so don't be like me go and get yourself an spf now i don't use the really really strong ones because this is my natural skin tone i actually haven't faked hands this week at all so i am a little bit more on the olive side i'm not super fair so i am able to get away with an spf 25 but i do believe they also have spf 50 as well so this one is the protective facial lotion and it's got green tea pantheral and sephoral and it is a broad spectrum sunscreen for daily use i love this it comes in a pump bottle and it's just the best formulation it's not too greasy or thick and it sits really well under makeup so that was an absolutely amazing find from them and it really wasn't too expensive compared to some other brands that i like like laroche posse and those kind of ones the last thing i want to show you was a definite splurge because i normally wouldn't want to spend this much on a daily facial moisturizer because of how quickly we obviously go through these kind of products but it's this one called the seeking silence facial hydrator and this is my sort of like not everyday moisturizer i would say i just put this one on when i'm not wearing makeup because i don't want to waste it by like potentially not actually soaking in under makeup so this one is squalane ginger root and bizabalol whatever that is absolutely no idea it's a lightweight hydrating fluid formulated to bring a sense of calm to sensitive skin now you may have noticed in some videos occasionally that i suffered from a bunch of breakouts on my forehead so last year i was actually hospitalized i had high grade cervical dysplasia so that was quite stressful and if you haven't got a pap smear recently this is your sign please please book yourselves in and always get checked regularly because i do and i did at the time and that is exactly how they found it out for me but what happened after that operation was i think all of my hormones and things in my body just went completely whack and i suffered from really bad breakouts on my forehead that were almost like acne actually and i've never had that in my life i've always been quite blessed to have clear skin so i really really needed to find a bunch of sensitive products hence going to esop because a lot of their stuff is really geared towards very sensitive skin and it's a really light touch so that was the moisturizer that i selected and that was really just to help me get my skin hydrated again and to kind of not cause any further irritation and really really calm down a lot of the redness and things that i was suffering from at the time so yeah i think it was really really good product for that it was very effective but it was pretty expensive i think it was 65 or something for that teeny tiny tub so up to you if you want to spend that much on a moisturizer if you're looking for a really luxe shopping experience and a great product then i would but yeah so that is it for my esop haul these are all my favorite products if you guys have any others that i am yet to discover then please leave them down in the comments below i would love to check them out the other range that i did really like is the parsley seed ones but i just haven't got around to going in and shopping for them because i'm trying to be a little bit budget conscious at the moment so that is it for today's video thank you guys so much for watching and i will see you next time bye you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hahxuttZOE0,hello there one and all and welcome to episode 317 of Love at First scent with me personally is coming to you live from YouTube if you've just come from the end of the previous episode and thank you very much for sticking around but if you're watching the recording then you're very very welcome as well please do leave a comment ask a question if you would like to and do consider subscribing to my channel if you have not already done so lots of comments they're all ready for this one first comment goes to Rich Mitch who says hi Stephanie is saying hello from NYC Rich says I thought this might have been the new Frederick Mal which is awful I haven't smelt it I went past a shop the other day that I thought might have it and I thought I need to kind of smell this but it was not there so I don't know whether it I think it's going to go on to sort of proper wide distribution within the next few weeks it's it's been exclusive for the moment to the places where Frederick Mao tends to be exclusive so I suppose places like Liberty in in London and the the Brand's own boutiques here and there so I have not tried it I'm very very curious to you woozie says was hoping for an uncut gem but I'll settle for this given ESOP is one of the few Brands where as an Australian I don't have to wait a year for it to get to us so there you go the notes on this do sound promising though says woozy uh one I've already smelled it says Eric I have a sample on my table and Andy says ESOP new release is quite exciting Sharon is also here watching from Dalek Dallas Texas so huge huge hello to all of you thank you very much for tuning in and yes as has already been said we have got here new from ESOP um idesis which uh is is a sort of literary artistic technique of emphasizing the meaning of of of of something through repetition uh I believe if something is described as eidetic that means it's it's a very very vividly memorable very vividly described so in some ways a brilliant name for a perfume but also tough act to live up to this um comes as part of the Brand's range of what do they call them other topias so a little while ago from them we had miracetti cast and Eremia or Eremia and I can't say that I particularly found any of those three especially memorable um and I say that as somebody who is generally a fan of the brand I mean I thought their um was it rozu from a few years ago the rose was really interesting and I and I have lots and lots of time for that Marrakech I think I think it does what it does extremely well is the booklet a press sample says woozy yes it's like a little press release booklet which we will um look at in a moment um so I think I think we should just get going and find out what this idesis is going to be like um Marrakesh intends from this house is lovely feels like a spa experience there's like on them like a really really brilliant spot experience the right okay here we go let us spray see what this is going to be like why is Rich Mitch suddenly turning into John Travolta um well it starts off absolutely fine it's got that kind of I guess the naturalness that the almost kind of hippie naturalness that you associate with the brand um very peppery quite seedery you know I wouldn't be surprised if there's a good dose of iso e super in there peppery Woody scedery a kind of at the moment like a very very very much quieter version of come to gas on black pepper but also I mean it'd be interesting to see how it develops but also rather sedate which I I don't think is the kind of adjective you would normally be using if you were spelling black pepper the that pepper opening is so overdone says Marie um never heard of this brand before says Gaza or you should check out Marrakech and I've reviewed a few of their things over the years on on the blog and on this channel so do do a little search for ESOP um is it Conjuring images says Gavin well it could very very apt question um not at the moment not especially it doesn't feel as multifaceted as it should be for that I mean I feel like I'm being excessively negative about it it's fine but it seems to be going down the route that the brand is going down generally with their perfumes of making things that are a little bit simpler and a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more immediately accessible and comprehensible which I guess is a way of doing perfumes it's not particularly a style that I'm drawn to I cannot stop at the moment just thinking of comsing out on black pepper and Marc Jacobs bang which also had a huge pepper opening let's look at the little booklet um onshamanda says uh good to see ESOP being highlighted they've had some quite special offerings some of which were sadly discontinued due to lack of Interest I assume um oh Gavin says I smelled uncut gem I love how we're spending a lot of time talking about a different perfume I will I def you know I'm going to talk about it on this channel as soon as I can get my hands on a few drops so uh the next chapter in the other topias fragrance collection takes the wearer to an imaginary world beyond the surface of the mirror a place where wooded depths lead to hypnotic spices and a pool of liquid Stillness fused with watery iridescent Florals there is not that much going on here um drawing on the myth of Narcissus and the struggle between the inner and outer selves is provocative yet comforting seductive yet distinctly unconventional how are seductive and unconventional opposites anyway a fragrance that lingers on the body and entrances the mind and let the aroma unfurl as these Pages unfold revealing the story of idesis okay so we'll give you a little bit of time top notes rousing Aromas of pettigram black pepper and a subtle floral Accord play across skin warmed by daily ablutions must be the first time I've seen the word ablutions in a perfume press release the heart notes Aromas of sorry start again Aromas of ambery Frankincense ambery frankincense okay spicy cumin and Woody Cedar oh there's a little bit of tautology Happening Here in trance the nose and those fortunate enough to pass by and base notes an aromatic epilogue of sandalwood cedar and vetiver Echoes through the day leaving behind notes of Desire written in Scent they are working very very hard to project I would something that I don't think this perfume is I think it's just a bit too clean and streamlined and pleasantly attractive to be those things it's like they're setting it up as something a lot more curvaceous and a lot more um buxom then there's a little bit about the other other topias um and then a quotation from Ovid and they haven't no said I noticed whether this one is also by barnabasio who I think composed the other ones anyway always always worth reading a little bit of Ovid there was a pool limpid and silvery with a no Shepherd came nor heard nor mountain goat and never bird nor Beast nor falling Branch Disturbed its shining peace grass grew around it by the water fed and trees to Shield it from the warming Sun share your Reflections on ideas by attacking ESOP skin care ah okay ablutions and of it in one press release um maybe it's use of repeated words to create a sense of a sentence says Gavin um and as katsi says oh my God they threw in of it too I enjoy an ablution myself says Eric yes nothing quite like a contribution um are there really that many Naturals in it says Marie it smelled quite synthetic to me with that overdose of iso is super yes I mean I'm thinking I3 super as well um it's not a huge amount to say about this one because I think you know the structure of pepper Cedar vetiver is not exactly unfamiliar and it is very very peppery and if I wanted peppery Woody peppery or long-lasting Woody peppery I would still be going for Camel to come the house on black um so yes I suspect I mean I'll see how it does on the blotter and I'll I may give it a wearing but I suspect this is going to be relegated like so many scents unfortunately into the great big you know fire under pleasant but forgettable pleasant but unremarkable filing cabinet of sense in the sky I wonder if their marketing is overly muscular to make up for the fragrances Rachel well it only sounds like it doesn't it um I like the opening but it's strayed into something musky smells like musky modern and boring says Eric sounds like uh okay ESOP room fragrances are great do not have any of their fragrances it says s Umar and pleasant but unremarkable is esop's whole bag isn't it says Enrique well no because Marrakech is definitely remarkable rosu is definitely remarkable they did a green one that I think they discontinued as somebody said for lack of Interest so yeah this seems to be the route they're going down at the moment and maybe maybe it's going to work for their particular customer base but but I think um I think it's a little bit of a shame because they're capable of doing more interesting more fascinating things okay so thank you very much for watching we're done for today I promise you as soon as I get my nose on a few drops of the Frederick Mal I will be reviewing it on this channel um but for now thank you very much for watching thank you very much for tuning in be good stay safe and I will see you soon thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBD4xXxBTc,hi guys welcome to my youtube channel to skin care design today i want to review the parsley seed antioxidant serum with you guys um so this is a product i usually don't use on a daily basis i only use this if i travel or if i'm in a very hot and humid country okay or maybe if it's summer and it's super super super hot but um usually like when i'm in like brazil in hong kong in some tropical country or in some support country like dubai or somewhere really really hot okay because i've got a combination skin i need to hydrate my skin but i prefer like a lightweight hydrator but when it's super super hot and even the lightweight hydrator feels too heavy on my skin i really like the antioxidant serum okay so this is a pro this is not like a typical serum this is um like a normal moisturizer okay so this is something i would use as a normal moisturizer and i wouldn't use a cream or lotion or something like this afterwards just this on top after i've cleansed um and toned my face okay so this comes in a 100ml glass bottle here with a pipet okay so um i will show you what it looks like on the skin as well um you can see here it feels like a normal serum very very liquidy and when you um use it on your face um it also it's okay i can actually feel my hands as well it's like an oil i would say it feels like an oil however it's not oily okay i believe this is a louis vuitton based okay so it gives you a little like a thick sticky um consistency but it feels like an oil at first but it's not oily it's not too oily for your skin so don't be afraid to use this or don't think it's it's going to be super super oily this will give you a really nice amount of hydration okay and yeah as i said i use this in very hot and humid climates uh when i don't want to use the cream and i still want to hydrate my face and i would definitely recommend this i really love this product especially as it has good antioxidants in it which is nice if you're in a big city if you're surrounded by pollution for example and want to do something good for your skin i can highly recommend this product absorbs really quickly as well as you can see it's already gone on my hand okay totally absorbed and my skin just feels um feels hydrated and i love this product it smells like parsley a little bit like parsley it's not as strong as the parsley zit antioxidant hydrator or some of the creams but it gives you a lovely herbal scent which lasts for a couple of minutes not that long to be honest yeah i really love this product and would i recommend it definitely and yeah if you've got any questions about the product please let me know in the comment box below and please don't forget to subscribe to my channel to give me thumbs up thank you for watching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF9Wl6MEEhs,hey ladies and gentlemen of the internet my name's adrian and now more than ever you should be washing those hands i mean honestly pandemic or not you should be washing your hands that said something you probably don't think too much about is the actual soap you wash with sure some of you probably just grabbed the typical dial or soft soap bottle that you're used to or whatever supplies your household whereas if you watched any home tour video really any celebrity ever or browse bathrooms on pinterest and you've definitely seen the famous brown bottle that is it's really everything i've ever wanted in a bathroom i think it's perfect it feels really nice marble from the ceiling [Music] and at nearly 40 us dollars is the hand soap worth look at that price point it definitely lies on the bougie end of which we're probably used to or would ever remotely spend on hand soap so here's everything you need to know about it esop as a brand is an australian luxury skincare brand actually that's owned by a brazilian company but moving on they're known for their fragrant smells their skin care products products like their hand soap to shampoo even post poo poo drops but that all said you're here to hear about that boogie hand soap the esop hand soap line comes in two signature variations the reverence aromatic wash and the resurrection aromatic wash first up is the reverence it's described as an unorthodox aromatic blend with botanical extracts and finely milled pumice which attributes to a really kind of cleansing exfoliating feel that's how i translate it it's something that's very textured in terms of scent profile you're looking at something that's very woody earthy and a smoky scent where the key ingredients are vetiver root petigrain and bergamot rind so this is something that you're not typically used to seeing in something like a hand soap again it's very earthy and it gives you a really texture feel almost like a gritty sand like feel when you're washing very exfoliating in its nature and satisfying an ad makes you almost feel extra cleanly when you're washing your hands but if you're not into that textured field then this one is not for you whereas the resurrection wash offers a more gentle formulation containing oils orange rosemary and lavender this scent profile is more citrusy woody and herbaceous with the key ingredients being mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas and this one this is the one that made me fall in love with the line of esop products and i would quantum crown the standard go-to product if you're trying it for the first time all esop products as a note are vegan and cruelty free so no ingredients are used on or tested on animals also on a safety note skin safe for example gave the resurrection line a 82 top allergen free rating listing it for you gluten nickel and other stats you can see here on screen now that all said at the end of the day what you're paying for is a unique fragrant hand soap and aesthetically pleasing packaging one that if you were to put in your guest bathroom people would think you got money he got money and the 16.9 fluid ounces packaging definitely gives you a sufficient amount of uses on average that lasts me a month or two plus depending on how generous i am with the pumps and or i succumb to the ancient asian art of putting a little water in the bottle when the soap runs though to prolong it but in all seriousness hand soap is probably something that while essential you don't think too much about or even willing to spend anything more than ten dollars on at that however if you are willing to invest a little extra into something that you should be using on a daily basis i'd argue it brings a little bit of extra satisfaction to your life or at least your house guess that you can't go wrong when it comes with the esop line it offers scents that are uncommon and make the act of washing your hands that much more enjoyable it's one that if you know me personally i feel is a great gift to give all around for someone who would never consider buying it in the first place only to realize that they've been missing out on it their whole life look ultimately at the end of the day you'll learn in these series of videos the term worth will always be subjective to a variety of factors is hand soap essential i'd argue yes do you need to spend 40 on it not at all esop hands hope to me succeeds in taking a mundane but essential task and elevating the experience so check out your local store if you have one or anywhere that carries it see if you can get a sample try out if a friend has it you'll thank me later or worst case you hate it and then simply replace the soap with some dial and boom all the aesthetics and allure of the famous esop bottle with whatever your soap choices free game if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button and consider

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XVy2fHfKJA,now having two kids the skin regime has had to pull back a little bit on how often and how long it can take me my skin can be very sensitive to the Australian climate with a lot of sun exposure my skin is combination skin I tend to have quite dry skin that's why I love the esa b c facial balancing gel after a long day out in the Sun cleanse of night put the gel on and feel hydrated especially waking up in the morning when I saw that it was vitamin C that's what really kind of Drew Me In I like the honey esque texture of the product I love rubbing it through my hands it just sinks into my skin so well I would just Pat it in like this and into my face I had a blemish on my chin and it went away the next day and I feel like this kind of covers all bases and makes my complexion really even and moisturiz but it doesn't make me feel greasy it sort of romanticizes my nighttime routine I look forward to it for the end of the day

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGkD-dD388,hi guys welcome to my youtube channel to skin care design today i want to review the esop mandarin facial hydrating cream for you i've used this cream for a bit now and just want to give you my honest opinion about the product and want to let you know whether or not i would repurchase it again um so a great thing about this cream is it comes in a glass container not like the 500 ml um containers like the ones i've reviewed before like this one the pump dispenser containers here they're quite popular obviously especially the hand wash hand and hand bar um so they come in plastic okay it's um yeah very you can see it's very thin plastic here and um the this screen here comes in a glass container this is something i really like okay so it doesn't come with plastic obviously the top is plastic feels a bit flimsy but so far so good um this comes in a 16 l glass container here which is quite handy it's not too big not too small so this will last you a long time as you can see i've used a little bit already i mean for a couple of weeks and um the nice thing is i really like the aroma okay it's also a little bit citrusy and yeah i will show you what it feels like or what it looks like on the skin on the skin it actually it's um yeah you can see it's more like a lotion okay it's not too thick i've got a combination skin i would say and this one is perfect for the colder months okay it's not too thick on the skin feels really nice on the skin and um very hydrating even though it's not too thick like like a proper cream this honestly feels more like a hydrator or like lotion not like a cream to me because it's so lightweight but hydrating at the same time so i would definitely recommend this cream if you've got like a combination skin or more dry combination skin i would recommend this product okay it's quite good um the center is quite strong i have to admit and it will last on the skin a little bit um so if you don't like citrusy like a mandarin smell um then i would i'm not sure if i would recommend it but other than that if you like it if you don't mind the the aroma of the product then i can highly recommend it and yeah would i repurchase it again um yeah probably yes i would because yeah it's a great great basic i would say a hydrator nothing super fancy about it apart from the price tag and the packaging of course but i really like the product um yeah if you've got any questions please let me know in the comments below please don't forget to give me thumbs up and subscribe thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_wJ0amt3xs,hey everyone talking about tacit by Aesop the notes in this are Yuzu Citrus basil vetiver and clove very high quality very like natural smelling citrus green with woodsy and rootsy vetiver undertones that kind of come out more and more as it dries down I think the ASAP is really underrated in the sense that when people talk about them they talk about them very highly but they aren't referenced as much as I would think that they should be for the quality and everything and everything I've tried from them has always felt like really good combination of high quality and like attractive smelling for the most part and this is definitely no exception I also feel like I like that they don't just put out a million things they kind of they come correct when they do put stuff out so yeah this feels tropical but not in a floral or like obvious way more like the feeling of like a laid back upscale Island Resort in the South Pacific with the like vetiver surrounding to me this just feels like contentment relaxation but also kind of invigorating at the same time so yeah if you like the idea of a citrus vetiver sense with some kind of Warm Spice and some green absolutely recommend this I really really like this 140 for a 50 milliliter unisex leaning masculine with low to moderate longevity and projection I would say so if that's a deal breaker for you maybe don't get it but I personally love it and it's not like a skin scent or something either at least not for me and uh yeah I'll link in the description where you can check it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-UId7YDI6U,foreign with a bit of a different type of video today I've just received a sample of Aesop's latest release in the mail this is obviously not a paid promotion or sponsorship none of my videos are however if you're on Facebook and you engage with enough fragrance activity uh you can simply get these samples for free sent to your door no charge I do have one eighth up fragrance called Marrakesh which I absolutely love and will come out with a review pretty soon of that but for today I thought I'd completely change it up and do a complete first impression so the little postcard here says that a Gloom was named after the potent threshold of Knight Ascent that summons the interior itself with lead notes of saffron Pink Pepper and cardamom giving away earthy Iris Patchouli and Sandalwood to land a thumbtuous and calming finish inside the sample it says it has notes of memo for saffron and Iris drifting between Landscapes both real and Luther the story of Gloom rests in the world of Dreams it's Rich florals warm spices and bit of water depth evoking Mysteries of the subliminal so I've never smelt it before let's see what it's like it smells so familiar as if if I have this in my collection but I don't quite know what it is it is somewhat reminiscent of Marrakesh which I'm looking at my collection now and a very small hint of Viking by Creed which might be from the woods and the spices I'm guessing as you can tell this video is completely spontaneous I'm normally a lot more prepared but I thought it would just be a little more entertaining to see a very thirst reaction if spicy yet subtle quite smooth and soft it's not like a Creed Viking where it's kind of a brief of after doing a fair few sprays of not projecting whatsoever kind of thought that I'd finish this video off but I might give it a few days maybe a week if my mind changes on it it's not doing much for me at the moment but I'll be back soon so to my surprise I'm actually back I wasn't actually going to finish this video as the fragrance simply didn't Captivate me enough but as a reviewer good or bad I'll try and do as many fragrances as I can so the reason the fragrance didn't really Captivate me enough is because it just lacks imagination there's nothing distinct about it it's just a bit of a Woody floral spicy mess where nothing really comes from it I've obviously given a few weeks of trying the sample over and over and the more I wore it the less interested in it I became but I can strongly say now that it really does nothing for me I feel like a lot more could have been done with it but who knows since L'Oreal bought it out maybe this is the new direction for Aesop I also vaguely remember making a bit of a comparison to Viking which I no longer get obviously the woods and the spice is somewhat reminiscent with a bit of that mintier chord as well but that comparison has since drifted it is unfortunate because I do prefer to make positive content showcasing fragrances I actually like but as a reviewer I have to talk about bad ones as well having sprayed it again now I go it's not even remotely on my skin so unfortunately this one was a bit of a myth as a first impression however I've got a lot of reviews on the way our fragrances I absolutely love so stay tuned for that thanks for watching [Music] oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LzmexSorRI,and i have it right here it's a beautiful spray it's a great size if you need to take it on the go it's made with rose metal bergamot peel and chamomile chamomile is definitely great for detoxifying and making sure that you are you know not stressed you're relaxed especially if you're on the go like me um it has a great scent it's very herbaceous um but it doesn't stay on your skin for long i feel like so many different people ask me you know yeah the brand is just very florally it's very um it's very earthy i smell like a garden i'm like no it smells great if you're into aromatherapy it's one of those brands that have really messed with the art of creating a really great scent behind it and really just awesome products again this immediate moisture facial is great for facial hydrosol is great for providing an additional moisture when you need it and for fatigued skin so i'm just going to test it right now and you know i'm immediately moisturized it also provides a nice glow so what i like to do with this hydrosol is really just use it as a toner um before i even start after after i cleanse my face after i hop out of the shower which i just did today um and then spray it all over which is great again you're getting the botanicals you're getting the chamomile you're getting the rose petal which again has been used for many centuries um from like kings and queens mainly queens to really just hydrate and you know make sure that the skin is supple and beautiful so that is the immediate moisture facial hydrosol which is great i highly recommend it let's move on over to my second lovely favorite which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XGz-19ZgSo,um it's a brand called aesop i don't know if you guys have heard of aesop but that they have an amazing product range um this is the mandarin facial hydrating cream and so what i love about this is it's very very lightweight so it's perfect for summer um and it's uh it's for normal and combination skin so as you can see the texture the texture is very light um and then so i'm just gonna show you i'm just going to use a little bit on this side so as you can see and once i rub it in you'll see but as you can see it's kind of this like cream eggshell color smells so good they're all about essential oils so this one has mandarin oil it has citrus uh let's see mandarin rind oil lemon rind and tangerine rind so it's a great citrusy very fresh for summer and so as you can see it rubs in really nicely and it's gone so i love this um so i tend to do some pats on the front and then some pats on the side and then this is great to just seal in moisture it's very lightweight um because in the summer we don't want anything too heavy and so it just it's a really really great deal also it's fifty dollars but if you buy it during the live stream you get uh you get fifteen percent off so definitely take advantage of that deal for live stream um uh and it smells so good so aesop is just a really really great brand and they have great face washes they have great moisturizers um so i would highly recommend this and then so once you moisturize your face uh for the summer you want to make sure the number one most important thing is sunscreen please wear sunscreen a lot of people ask me how what's the best way to get rid of wrinkles or prevent wrinkles and the only answer is sunscreen everything else is preventative so if you don't wear sunscreen and then you get wrinkles when you're 40 or you're 50 people want to correct them but the best way to approach skin care is not corrective it's preventative and so the only thing that can do that is sunscreen because it prevents your skins from the damaging uva and uvb rays um a lot of my friends are like but rex i still want to tan um you will still tan uh when you when you wear sunscreen so don't worry about that so my favorite sunscreen lately is this super goop how cute that is super goop daily dose vitamin c and spf and so what's great about this is that it's a broad spectrum sunscreen so anytime you buy sunscreen make sure that you look for broad spectrum because here's kind of like a quick little thing there's uvas and uvb rays that come through the sun so think about uvb rays as your burning rays those are the ones that you put on sunscreen so that you don't burn but that's only five percent of the uv rays that the sun uh that hits our skin 95 of the rest of that is uva rays and even those those don't burn your skin what they do is because they're shorter length they break down the elastin and collagen in your skin so you get these little fine lines and you get these wrinkles and you want to make sure that you have a sunscreen that covers all of that and so what's so amazing about this sunscreen i'll show you the difference it's um super lightweight you just shake it it's by super goop um super goop is a brand that only focuses on sunscreen so you know that they have a huge expertise here um and then so as you can see let's see see if i can go a little slower so it's like a liquidy serum because it is a serum and what's great about it is it's an spf that is infused with vitamin c so after you put on your moisturizer you want to make sure that you layer that on with sunscreen so also i'll show you see how light that texture is so this texture really is great for sunscreen because a lot of sunscreens tend to be really heavy and then you're at the beach or you're at the sun and you just feel like your skin is really clogged up so i just kind of want to show you a side by side this is you know a typical drugstore sunscreen and then this is gonna be the supergoop daily dose so as you can see this one is super lightweight this one is super just white and so even though how do i block this on there so as you can see the super goop is really really lightweight but it gives spf 40 coverage and this one gives spf 30 but it's like it's like putting yogurt on your face so i highly recommend checking this out um oh sorry let me uh present it and the great thing is it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI8OW-5Xx5s,favorite thing of all the things so it's this Aesop hand bomb it's the resurrection aromatic hand bomb this one is Mandarin Rosemary and Cedar guys I am obsessed with this so first off like you barely have to press for this to come off but and that's why like be careful with anything that's like packaged in this kind of like I don't know what this product like this material is considered but um anything that's like this you have to be careful because barely pressing it makes product come out so when you open it sometimes like there'll be product already like starting to spell out so just be careful so you don't waste products but what I love about this product is the smell and the feel um so I'm just gonna like you can use as much or as little as you want of this because it's so thin that it doesn't feel sticky and that's something that I struggle with a lot when it comes to uh hand cream I love cream but hand cream sometimes it just makes makes you feel sticky like it when you when you touch anything like you leave like marks I don't know I don't know why it bothers me but it does but the smell of this like I think peeling well either a mandarin or an orange or anything like citrusy like imagine when you peel that how your hands smell how like the air around you smells it's kind of like that but the cedar part of it gives it like this like kind of musky smell and then obviously the Rosemary gives it that Herby you know how to describe it it just reminds me of my childhood if I'm being honest like my house felt like this growing up so it's just like a very refreshing and nostalgic smell but I love that it just like absorbs into your skin and like I don't I don't know if you'll be able to see but like do you see how that's kind of like glowing a little bit it instantly like started to hydrate my skin and it says here that it readily readily absorbed moisturizing balm to effectively hydrate and soften your hands and it has a bit of carotene and um this other thing that I'm not going to pronounce but um apparently this is one of Aesop's most uh sought after products and they have this in a few different um scents as well I know there's one that I think is like a blue one a blue like tin and then there's another one that's green maybe um but this one is the the like light pinkish kind of color and it smells incredible so I would highly recommend this if you love cream this is like something that you can really have like on the go you use this like you just like throw this into your purse if you travel this is perfect it's only 2.6 ounces so like perfectly safe to travel with and if we eat through it into like a bigger purse like this would not be a problem it's easy to apply like I don't know it just like it left I was in shock when I tried it on like a few months ago at the store because I didn't think I would like it and when I put it on I was like wow like even right now like it doesn't usually like hand cream kind of sticks or just like creams in general they kind of like stick your fingers stick together this does not do that at all and it's 25.50 but like I said like you can use a little bit of this and it goes such a long way so it ends up being so worth it um so yeah you can even apply this to like other parts you can apply this to your feet um you can apply this kind of everywhere and you just like massage it in and it just feels good it smells good if you don't like the specific smell of Mandarin or Rosemary or Cedar like I said they have other um scents so you can go look at those and see if you might like that but this one was just the one that called to me most because I love the smell like I said super nostalgic scent um but yeah so that is those are all the products um that I have for you guys today um you guys right now during this live stream can get 15 off anything that I showed you and you can also get um 15 off for the next 30 minutes after this live stream so 9 p.m um EST or 6 p.m PST so make sure that you do that because you know especially that the discounts can be applied to other discounts like that it's automatic that 15 gets applied when you check out but if there is already a discount on that product the 15 is applied to that discount as well so you could get super low prices for some of these products that can be a little bit pricier or you know just saving any kind of money is always great I'm a huge believer in that so definitely make sure to take advantage of that and I'll kind of just recap really quickly what I showed you guys so it was this glow super goop glow screen um SPF 40. this closest Sport lip balm this Joanna Vargas bright eye firming mask and this is it this zit sticker little patches so I will see you guys next week 8 P.M EST 5 p.m PST and so nice seeing you guys again find me on Instagram at Sasha stuff underscore like I said I will see you guys next week make sure to shop everything

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZgkjxV2PsY,[Music] hi guys welcome to my youtube channel today i want to introduce the parsley seed facial cleansing oil from esop some australian skincare brand and i've used this cleansing oil for a bit now i used to have traditional gel based cleansers but i started using a cleansing oil uh believe it or not i've got an oily skin and i thought i would try an oily cleansing oil instead of a gel-based cleanser because i felt like the traditional gel based cleansers are just too strong for my face and felt like they would dry out my skin so i thought i'm gonna use the cleansing oil instead and so far my skin has reacted very positively about it so um yeah i really like this product believe it or not this is like a traditional like a typical oil i would say what i usually do is i use a little bit here and cleanse my face obviously with your oil like this and then i wash it off with water um you can see it here it's a little bit yellowy there are antioxidants in it which i like yeah i love the whole parsley seed range it's it's really great if you need something with antioxidants want something with antioxidants i mean you don't really need it but it's quite good if you live in a big city with pollutions um it smells a little bit like olive oil being toilets i don't even know if they're olives in it but it smells like olive oil and feels like olive oil in the skin and yeah then you can just rinse it off with water and your skin feels clean very clean and hydrated you know it doesn't dry out the skin um it's fantastic i really am obsessed with this product it's so good and um yeah would i repurchase it again i would definitely would um if i would want to purchase the cleansing oil again definitely yes and yeah so this is my review for the parsley seed antioxidant cleansing oil if you've got any questions please let me know in the comment box below and please don't forget to subscribe to my channel and to give me thumbs up thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wcwdYlrAAg,[Music] [Music] hey Beautiful People how y'all doing hope you guys are doing fantastic I'm here today to share with you guys one of my favorite favorite favorite product lines for skin care face care and just care overall because they have products for literally everything so the name of this brand is called ASA and it is originally from Australia but there are stores all around the world so you can find this brand in a lot of places and of course you can always buy online so I walked into the store on Black Friday at the time I had never heard of it I just went in because it looked really pretty and I love the packaging of all the products and I kind of just asked what the store was and they told me that they try and use like the most natural ingredients it's not vegan it's not organic but it's close and they are high-end products so this is high-end skincare and body care you're not going to find this like at Target or Walmart or anywhere like that um it is high-end skincare however it performs so well so when I walked in I didn't know what to buy so it kind of just picked the products that I thought I might like and then I ended up placing an order a couple weeks later because I fell in love and saw a drastic change in my skin and so I ordered a couple more products but I'm still kind of trial and error because I don't know which products work and which don't and there's no place to kind of lead reviews so you don't really know how it worked for other people either anyway on my Vlog Channel I talked a lot about it and a lot of people saw a difference in my skin so I wanted to make a review for this Channel right now I'm not wearing any makeup only thing I'm wearing is lipstick because I wanted you to see what my face looks like and since using this product line I've seen a great Improvement in my skin so the first product I'm going to review is a parsley seed facial cleansing oil if you guys look at the packaging all the products in all of the lines have the same packaging glass jar there are a couple of things that don't have glass but you see the look of this I love the Sleek packaging and I love the fact that it's unisex so what this is is a cleansing oil the top fell off that's something that they need to fix cuz the top did fall off it says that it's an exceptionally mild facial cleanser suited to dry combination and sensitive skin and the first three ingredients are avocado oil sweet almond oil and Macadamia Oil so how I use this is I pour a little bit in my hand and then I add a couple drops of water and I mix it together and then I put it on my face and I rub it in my face it is an oil like consistency but when you start rubbing it in your face you see it really penetrating into your skin what this does for me is it takes off all my makeup the oil really invigorates my skin and it really pulls the makeup from my skin and and then it all comes off and my skin feels really soft and really moisturized it doesn't feel greasy or oily it just feels really moisturize and that's why I fell in love with the product it was efficient with taking off my makeup but for me I use a makeup wipe before I take off my makeup with a soap so yeah and you can always double cleanse if you want to you can use the oil cleanser and then use a second cleanser but this is enough for me I'm good after this so my face is really really really moisturized and I love that product so once I do that I tone my face with my toner they do have tons of toners too but I couldn't be bothered to look through that and then I put on this in the daytime and this is the parsley seed antioxidant serum it says it is an antioxidant Rich daily use serum moisturizer for normal to combination and sensitive skin types enhance with acious grape and parsa Seed extracts the first three ingredients here are aloe vera juice pe60 almond glycerides and water those are the first three ingredients um this has a drop top or dropper okay so this is how you use it you just put a couple of drops into your hands and then you rub it all over your face and it really sinks in it looks like it's not going to sink in at first like it's just sitting there but it does sink into your skin some people use this just as their moisturizer but because for me it's winter time I do like to put my lotion on top of it but with this one I did not even mean to buy it I meant to buy The Parsley seed like the pure parsley seed oil however um I picked the wrong thing online and they sent me this I like it it works really well it performs really well um and it does have vitamin C in it so it's great for you know the daytime but it's not something that I feel was like completely necessary I think the lotion by itself works great so that's what we'll talk about next The Parsley seed and antioxidant hydrator I fell in love with this lotion because they gave it to me as a sample and I used it I think gave me like four of them and I used it every day for 4 days and I saw a huge difference in my complexion like just the smoothness of my face um the way my pores didn't look cuz I couldn't see them um I just saw my face looked a lot brighter and healthier and plump so that's what made me go back and place in order so it says that it is a light rapidly absorbed facial moisturizing fluid that delivers superb antioxidant hydration and the first three ingredients here are water rose oil and glycerin even though this comes on very light when you use it show you it looks like it's very light however when you put it on your skin it's actually pretty thick it does have like a very very very moisturized feel to it and it does have like a little bit of shine which is really nice it's not like an oil shine it's just like a healthy glow and you can see my face has that healthy glow and that's because of the lotion so I love love love love love that lotion so the next thing I have to share is the geranium Leaf body cleanser so this is a body wash and I have the small one there's a bigger bigger bottle and what they say it is is an aromatic body cleanser for all skin types a fabulous alternative to regular soap enhanced with geranium leaf extract oh I've been using this wrong it says massage a generous amount onto damp skin before rinsing thoroughly but I've been actually using it with my loofah and maybe that's why I don't think it's all that great cuz I have all the following directions but um the first three ingredients are water sodium low sulfate and Bane and this one's good for 12 months it does have a little thing on the back where it shows you how long it's good for um I think this is okay this is not something I would repurchase from how I've been using it like I said I've been using on my loofah and rubbing it in it smells really good all the products in this line do smell different but they all have a very earthy woodsy you know aromatic smell it's very hard to describe the way that they smell but if you're into like the real natural scense of things then you will like the way that these products smell but they all do smell different and on the website before you buy something if you click on each item I think it has like a tab that says um what to expect and it tells you just the way it smells so you know um yeah like I said this wasn't all that it was whatever it's not something I would ever repurchase because I think it probably was pricey and it's other things work a lot better so I will go ahead and try it the way that they asked me to try it and if it's better than I said it was then I'll put a little note in the video so my second like favorite product in the line this product is life to me ooh y'all just don't know it is a geranium Leaf hydrating body treatment so this is a Body Oil okay the best body oil I've ever used as far as the way it hydrates my skin it says it's an intensive Botanical hydrating treatment for dry and dehydrated bodies first three ingredients are sweet almond oil Hazel seed oil and Macadamia seed oil but it has a lot of different oils in here um this like I said fantastic you put it on the skin it's a little dropper so you can really control how much comes out of it but it's just a body oil guys nothing super super super different about it except for the fact that it really hydrates my body and it does give me a nice glow but the way it hydrates it's not just sitting on my skin which is why I like it that I also love it because you can pair it with anything I've taken my lowest performing body products and just poured a couple drops of oil into it rubbed it in and it just took any product to the next level so if you already have a body lotion that you're obsessed with if you add this to it it it takes it to the next level you can use it alone and it works great alone too you can even just have your skin be a little damp and massage it into your skin while it's damp and it works so well it has more of like a citrusy like orange scent kind of hard to explain but like I said it's all still a little earthy so it's nice but I think you guys will enjoy this one I can't go back after this I just truly I truly can't okay the last product I'm going to share with you guys and I love this product too honestly I love it and it's the deodorant it says it's an aluminum free deodorant spray for me and women and the first three ingredients are water witch hazel and poly sorbate 80 all you're supposed to do is take this and spray a couple sprays under your arms some people use this all over their body as a body spray because it smells so good but on top of the fact that it smells so good it actually performs well I just spray three under each arm and I'm good for the entire day I don't get mesy just know that I don't have a job that requires me to do like a whole lot of physical activity so for me I don't have to reapply I can go the entire day and I smell great and when you lift up your arms to like reach for something or just do anything with your arms you can smell it so that's a big plus I've also used it when I'm going to go to the gym and it works great like I did not get musty at all so I'm obsessed with it it's my new deodorant but like I said some people use it all over their body just as a body spray and it smells so good so if you guys are interested go ahead and check it out I'll put the link below also you can watch other videos on other people's reviews to see what they thought about the different products they have a ton of products so it's overwhelming looking at all the stuff to figure out what you want to buy and they don't have ratings like best sellers or anything it's just kind of you know up to you to make those decisions I believe everything is unisex so it's good for men and for women because the products are so expensive it is probably a good idea to ask for samples so you can order samples online or you can go into the stores and ask for samples first see how you like it before you know committing to it unless you just like taking chance and said hey take your chance but I'm really impressed by this product line I do want to try some of their other stuff um I just haven't been this excited about a product line in a long long time and I also feel like it's a treat so if you guys have any questions about it please let me know but if you don't big kisses to you all thank you so much for watching and I hope you have a fantastic day see you in the next video peace love and life [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nz64zHSgOM,hello everybody and welcome to yet another episode of the gentleman's club in today's episode I'm going to be doing a quick review of a product from this company called asop I spoke about this company many times cuz I went to Hong Kong and experien purchasing from this company for the first time and I bought about roughly about $130 worth of items from this company during my trip to Hong Kong and I went to the asop that's located I guess there on Hollywood Road which is in uh Central and I bought so much stuff that they actually gave me a whole lot of free samples of different things so today I use this one this is called geranium Leaf body cleanser and you use this inside the shower uh this is I guess this is for for cleansing skin is kind of like soap um I went inside the shower first you know I showered the normal way using my regular Tallow soap and a washcloth and I scrubbed and did all that stuff and then after I got done with that then I just applied this to my hands and then I applied it to my body uh this says this is made from geranium Leaf Mandarin rind and Berger moth rind and down here the description says exhilarating low foaming shower gel enhanced with duranium leaf extract to cleanse without drying the skin suitable for all skin types the spense onto hands are damp sponge and massage over wet skin while under the shower so I did exactly just that uh the smell of this is very good the smell smells just like uh lemon or or some type of citrus but a very lemony smell once I got out of the shower and I dried off you know I tried smelling myself to see if the smell was still there it wasn't really so the smell is not something that's going to stay with you all that long but uh I I suppose it does its job and you know we have to take their word for that does cleanse I I can attest to that but you know as I started putting on on my body you know it started lathering a little bit you know just from hand hand uh rubbing contact you know it started foaming a little bit so you know it looked like it was doing something it looked like it was working uh like I said the smell don't really stay with you but maybe it's it's a quite nice uh application type product this thing this company this company is very good I have some other products from them and they work extremely extremely well it's just that the price is so expensive on a whole lot of these products I don't know if I would buy from this company all the time like every time you run out of this you have to go back and get a refill or get a new bottle or whatever it could get expensive over time I think personally for me especially with the smell not lasting on this all that long I would just stick with my regular Tallow soap it was nice using the uh just a sample while I have it but as soon as they're gone that's that's it uh so it says dispense on the hands or damp sponge and massage over wet skin it was okay for me to put on my hands because I had already scrubbed with a uh with a washcloth before I had put this on so you know I got off all the dead skin but if you're just applying this directly to your hands and then to your skin and you rubing it all over and then you rinse it off and you call that done this is one thing that messes me about in my head about a lot of people I don't know how you can wash without a washcloth okay you use that washcloth to scrub off a lot of the dead skin it's not just about smelling better but it's also about getting off all that dead skin that you have built up cuz you're you're constantly shedding you're not going to shed like a snake all at one time but you know you're flaking non-stop constantly and leaving dirt all over the floor and whatever you may not be able to see it with a naked eye but trust me every single day you shed off so much skin and that's what you're getting inside the shower and using that washcloth for but normally I would just apply this I mean if I was just going to use this straight I would apply it to a washcloth and then you know scrub and get it off I don't know if you guys can hear that those those cicor out there it's summertime they do those loud chirping noises whatever anyways would I get this no but it was fun using while I H it anyways that's my review of the asop geranium Leaf body cleanser I thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in the next one and until next time keep it classy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HOWUx24bvY,what's up guys jay here and thank you for watching century and today i'm gonna be talking about a fragrance that i have smelled recently uh i got my nose in it really recently already and it's pretty good and i thought i wanted to share it with you guys i haven't actually got a full bottle of it but i have a small sample and that is esop or aesop's tacit and it's um a fragrance by i think it's an australian house i think esop is an australian house uh they usually do like body soaps and hand soaps and creams and all that kind of thing they do have a small lineup of fragrances and this is one of them i think there's a total of about six or seven now um this one i think came out in 2015 so it's one of the older ones but this one is really really good and i want to share it with you guys so what this is is kind of a take for me i think it's like a take on a classic cologne but it's done a bit uniquely and a bit differently and i really like that i'm going to spray some on my hand of course this isn't the atomizer so i can't talk about it but i have used the robot the atomizer is pretty good they come in 50 ml bottles and they're not that cheap so so do definitely expect to pay out a bit more than you probably should for it still it's a good sense so let's get into it of course these small atomizers are terrible but yeah very very nice i haven't actually checked the note breakdown of this one but for me it smells like there's citrus in there i can tell that there's woodiness probably vetiver in here you can feel that quite a bit um i'm not sure if there's mint i'm getting like a minty feel to it but uh not strong it's not too strong but it's in there somewhere it's like a herbal minty kind of feel to it so it could be a mint some kind of leaf i'm definitely feeling something in here um what you're kind of getting is a fresh woody herbal citrusy kind of fragrance and for me it works really well they say it's a unisex they say that pretty much all their fragrances are unisex i would say this one does feel a bit masculine but um i do know women that wear this and it does smell really good on them too so either can wear it it kind of gives off like a luxury vintage soapy vibe if that makes any sense uh and yeah for me it just really does the job like i really like it so yeah definitely a solid one to get and the performance i've tried actually isn't that bad it's a pretty good performer as well so definitely a nice one from the house of aesop or esop all right then guys that's my video for today i do plan to get a full bottle of this one soon so when i get a full bottle i'll make another video on it and there's a few more i want to get to so there's a few different bottles i want to get so when i get them i'll make videos uh comment below your favorite esop or a subscent if you smelt one uh let me know what you would recommend and i'll try and get it alright then thank you so much for watching guys i really hope you enjoyed the video and i really hope i'll see you again here soon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdNxCMSSgC0,hi welcome back everybody to my channel where i review some luxury products that i enjoy around my house um today i wanted to go through my aesop collection with you and i thought maybe we would do it a little bit differently and just go around the house and see where i have some products displayed so here in the kitchen i have two uh soap dispensers liquid soaps um the one is the resurrection aromatic hand wash uh this one is amazing the it says it's the most known one i think with mandarin wind rosemary leaf and cedar um i also tried out the other hand wash which has a little bit of grains in it or a little yeah exfoliating things i don't like that one um as much so what i did is to i enjoy putting two hand washes here in the kitchen and what i did is i put the geranium leaf body cleanser next to it it can double up as a hand wash just as nicely and so myself and other people who want to wash their hands in the kitchen have a little bit of options the body cleanser the geranium one has geranium leaves of course also mandarins and bergamont there are two lovely scents next to each other so then in the front door at the entrance of my house i have some masks available there and i also have the geranium leaf rinse free hand wash just when you go out or you come in or somebody comes in they can clean their hands it's rinse free and of course with all the coveted measures that are luckily winding down it's ideal to have it in hand when you first use it it smells a lot like a lot of alcohol but once that alcohol dispenses and goes away or diffuses you really have this lovely scent on your hands so as an alcohol rinser i really like this one it gives afterwards a very nice and pleasant smell which you don't get with your typical um yeah hand washes or rinse free hand washes so and then in one of my restrooms or toilets i have the post poo drops um yeah guys i'm not going to talk too much about it it's quite clear in the name what it's for um ah the jury is still out on this one i like the scent but i haven't made a very good investigation about its effectiveness so the idea is that after you did you know the big message um you put some drops in the toilet and it should make a film um over the water so the bacteria don't get out or can create a scent or they locked in or it cancels it i don't know how it works the thing is i don't use it consistently i should i will try to make um an effort to really test it out more and to give you my thoughts afterwards um it i i like the scent as as its own and i i do think you smell it when you do it um when you put it in in the toilet or in the water of the toilet um but i don't know how how much how very effective it is i don't know but it's quite it's one of the most popular products so a lot of people do seem happy about it okay so this is the area above my bathtub i have some grown alchemist products over there i have to admit something i bought them i love the scents but i don't i'm not convinced of the effectiveness compared to other shampoos and conditioners so i do feel uh feel i do refill them with products that i really enjoy um and like this every everything keeps clean and it keeps very aesthetically pleasing even though i use the products within that i really love i also have this one maybe a little bit of an extra it's the peppermint body wash from rain pharma again i already mentioned it in previous videos i love rain pharma and i love peppermints men's peppermint smells this one in the warm water it's very invigorating it's fresh i love to um just uh put one squirt in um when i leave the water running um and and it makes your whole bathroom feel and smell fresh and alive and then i have here the body lotion or the hand balm from aesop why do i put it here because i often use it as a body lotion because if i put it next to the hand wash the hand wash is most of the time finished much quicker than i can finish the handball so i thought yeah i would put it in the bathroom and use it here but i have to say i love it as a handball but it's not suitable for me i think as a body lotion because it doesn't sink into the skin quite fast if you use it as a body lotion so it's not ideal i will put it next to an asop and wash again i think so i think that are all of my aso products i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up and subscribe thank you so much guys see you next time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w8A4M19nRU,hi guys welcome to my channel to skin care design today i want to introduce the esop into mine's facial toner so as you know i've got a like combination skin and i thought okay i would use an into my special toner on the website it actually says this is good for combination skin um but for me it was still a little bit harsh and i started using other products now so this comes in a one in a 200 ml a bottle as you can see i haven't used a lot to give it a try for for like a week i think you always need one or two weeks to give to try the product to see whether the skin reacts to it or if you end up liking it or not um so this is i think this is really good if you've got like maybe some pimples there's salicylic acid in it it also comes in a glass bowl which are like salicylic acid which has a nice cinnamon and the caramel blend um which is nice because it actually um it's very calming um so i'll just show you what is this yeah i will show you what it's like on the skin i mean it's like a normal toner i would say but for me it felt like it would dry out my skin i can can actually feel it on my skin as well it feels like it's drying out my skin even though my my hands are wet now but for me it was a little bit too strong and i started using the um another the i started using another product um i started using the b and t balancing toner instead and not the intro lines anymore because this was just too strong my skin felt dry and irritated afterwards even though there's camomile in it which should be very calming but yeah for me this was not a match not gonna lie so yeah just wanted to give you a quick review and i will definitely review the bee and tip and think toner as well for you guys
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pEZ0VHaVdAU&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biowood.my%2F&feature=emb_imp_woyt,hello welcome to my youtube channel welcome to skincare design today i want to introduce the lucent facial concentrate from esop um so this is coming from something called which is plus range okay there's a little plus on here and this means there are a lot of vitamins um in this product which is obviously really good um for your skin so it always have i would always recommend antioxidants and vitamins in your skin care routine and what i like about this product so at first this comes in a 60 ml bottle which is um not as big being totally honest but this lasts quite a long time as you don't need a lot of this product okay so the price is around 100 pounds which is obviously also a high price point i've noticed the products from the plus range a little bit more pricey because of all the like premium ingredients there's rose petal in it there's near cinnamite in it vitamin c it's yeah it's a lovely product um so i personally have got a more combination skin i use this just after um cleansing toning and after toning and before the moisturizer so i layer this product after my toner i add a few drops onto my face and then i apply my moisturizer or my lotion okay so this is a lovely product if you want to layer it if you just want to make sure your skin has got some extra vitamins and i will show you what the consistency is like so it comes in the pipette which is quite nice so you don't use too much of the product you can see here it is almost it looks almost watery okay so you don't need a lot just a few drops and yeah feels almost watery a little bit thicker than a toner but it's very much watery on the skin um and not as thick as a traditional serum i would say so it's very lightweight absorbs quickly and yeah and you treat your skin you really spoil your skin i would say and give your skin more hydration vitamins and some amazing extra amount of ingredients you know so i would highly recommend this product i know the price point is high but in my opinion it's worth it um if you just want to make sure to add some vitamins like really high quality products um to your skin care routine i can highly recommend this product yeah if you've got any questions please let me know in the comment box below and i would appreciate if you give me thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel thank you so much for watching and have a lovely day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdumVHoWMko,hi guys and welcome back to my channel today we are talking esop and their resurrection aromatique hand wash i've seen this so many places and people love it i guess today i'm doing videos a few videos on things that people seemingly love and i'm like okay let me give it a whirl um this is you get 16.9 ounces it retails for 39 and it is a gentle formulation containing oils of orange rosemary and lavender to effectively cleanse the hands without drying them out dispense into damp hands lather then rinse thoroughly the key ingredients are mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas i've just about used this whole bottle in about less than a month because of you know baby changing diapers 10 15 times a day yeah you're gonna go through this really fast um but what do i think this first of all has an it has a uh aromatherapy smell so if you're not into that aromatherapy smell and this probably wouldn't be for you because of the smell it is a stronger smell it's not bad i'm more like perfumey spells but this is fine does it keep your hands from drying out so to some extent yes is it it's just it's a few steps above soft sole you know the the drugstore soap this this did i will say my hands did not feel as dry using this than when i used just regular soap regular hand soap and i liked that was it a noticeable change yes was it life-changing change not necessarily but it was a noticeable change especially for someone who is washing their hands constantly throughout the day so [Music] i like it i'm not fond necessarily of the smell but it's just an aroma type of a therapy type of smell you can you can smell the um rosemary and the botanical extracts and you know i do like the smell of lavender but that's not the one that is potent through it's it doesn't smell like medicine i say aromatherapy because i know aromatherapy can smell sometimes like medicine type of but it smells like a cleansing of the air and i feel like aromatherapy sometimes can be a feeling like oh you walk in you're like oh is this aromatherapy in here is it oh it feels nice or it smells like you're about to get a cleansing i don't know why i did this like where am i looking up to i don't know but i'm thinking of when i enter a spa sometimes and it it has that aromatherapy smell and you're like oh it's relaxation time and that's kind of how this smells except it's not relaxation time i'm just washing my hands so do i like it yes yeah i do i do like it i do like it and i see what all the fuss is about and how about i show you what it what it looks like it's a gel you guys see that it's a gel um and it lathers really good i like it so all the fuss okay i get it i get it especially if i didn't wash my hands so frequently i would say oh it's okay you know but because i wash my hands you know 10-15 times a day yeah i i could tell a difference i could tell a difference and in my cuticles and how dry my cuticles were um they weren't as dry so yeah i hope that helped you guys to figure out if it's something you were looking at and maybe trying or something of that nature it's definitely worth a try i really liked it so yeah i hope you guys have an amazing day i will see you next time my daughter's little play houses in the background there you go so i will see you guys next time have an amazing day bye yeah guys i like it i like it i believe it used to come in a glass bottle i love me a glass bottle the funny thing is that if it came in a glass bottle i'm like oh would that make you want to buy it more it kind of makes you makes it feel more substantial and that sort of thing but yeah i like it and it it is it is better for my hands yeah concerning drying the whole you know drying of the hands and stuff yeah so it's weird because i feel like i haven't done it i know i haven't done a video in like a month but i feel like i have so much to say and so many things to share and my mind is already on to the next but i don't have time to do it so i have to wait a few more days and see if i can i can get those videos out yeah anyway okay i'm done babbling i'll see you guys next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPy26X2eU&t=11s&ab_channel=MarkKwak,hi everyone my name is mark quak and we're talking about my favorite things i struggle with today's product because i i love this product but at the same time it's hard for me to recommend to people because it's like is it worth it is it not worth it so expensive for what it is but you know what i'm just gonna talk about it because it is actually one of my favorite things the aesop resurrection aromatique hand wash it's soap hand soap aesop is a brand that i have loved kind of the the design and look of for so long it's it's a kind of aspirational brand because frankly if i bought aesop everything like my moisturizers were asap everything was just aesop i'd be bankrupt the truth is no one needs this product no one needs to use this product whatsoever and it's not it's not even i won't even say it's worth the money even though it's a great product it's a dilemma in my head because like i know i shouldn't be buying products like this but i also love products like this it's a dilemma and i'm sure many of you guys who either own aesop products or have thought about it are in a very similar position so let me talk specifically about their i i think this is their number one product the most popular product in their whole catalog the story behind this my story at least is that i saw this soap at a bunch of restaurants like high-end restaurants in san francisco if you go to a nice dinner it's a celebration maybe it's a birthday maybe it's you know an anniversary and then you know at some point during the meal you're probably gonna have to go to the bathroom right so you do and this aesop resurrection is waiting for you there you give it a couple pumps and you start washing your hands you're like oh my god this thing smells so awesome the experience of that bathroom because you know these are nice restaurants so they probably have nice lighting in there and all this stuff all of it is like a great hand washing experience like something that is a mundane and like normal task becomes this kind of experience getting this hand soap in your own home like you get a bit of that experience so the product itself like it is a great hand soap it is the consistency is good the smell and the the aroma is like is really awesome like it feels great going in the hand there's not much that makes it like revolutionary but it's ever so much better than all the other hand washes you use that you actually remember it or think about it a little and that's what made me purchase this product this is the cream of the crop this is the one that i think is the gold standard now anytime you go out and come back in you're washing your hands like a ton so each time you get that nice experience because you have a great soap but what are the cons to this like what are the issues now it's really all about the price right it's like at the end of the day the big con is that this is a forty dollar hand soap forty dollar hand soap i can't even say that without feeling ridiculous you can get soft soap from target for two dollars sort of that 38 delta it's it's that being said i mean i guess you do get a decent amount this is 17 fluid ounces and also you don't need that much soap like each pump is not a huge amount going away so it does last for months but you know it doesn't stop it from being a 40 hand soap at the end of the day it still is and alongside that the extra negative thing here is that if you want to refill this if you want to let's say you know get a big jug and just refill this bottle you can't like they only sell it in this size essentially and they have a refillable version that does not have this pump for one dollar less so normally this is thirty 39 you can get like a 38 one without this little pump so you're saving a dollar i mean so overall you know in a year you might spend instead of spending i don't know 10 15 on hand soap you might spend 120 so it's up to you whether you think that's worth the money or not i do vouch for the brand aesop in terms of their quality of their products though like i've i have been lucky enough to own maybe about four or five of their products i've had their deodorant i have a lot like a hand lotion i have been lucky enough to try a bunch of different asop products and all of them are excellent there really is a quality difference now whether it's worth you know 500 percent the price 600 800 the price that's really up to you but i can at least vouch that the product is quality so overall my thought is if you want to treat yourself and you wash your hands a ton which you should be right now and you just want that zing that extra zing in your life of something that you you know you're fed up with uh just like mundane life and you want that kind of extra experience aesop resurrection hand soap this is my recommendation here i struggle because it's so effing expensive but you know if you want that top of the line experience this is this is the one i would recommend massive struggle to get this video out because i don't really want to showcase how bougie i am but it is great it is great i have to admit so one of my favorite things thanks so much for watching i'm mark kwok and i will see you on the next one [Music]

reeboks which is not eso but niacinamide um hydrating serum because it is super good and it's beautiful step before hydrating cream so yep i see you guys adding it all to your uh bag which is wonderful uh so again we had esop cleanser which is the first step in your skincare routine uh amazing product comes in an amber glass bottle which is hello good for the planet because we use so much plastic use sunglass and esop is providing that which is great thank you so much uh looking you know like a little medicinal jar bottle from long time ago which i personally love i'm such an old soul after that we use the step two was a toner which is issa in two minds facial toner for combination skin if you want to really get rid of your oily uh you know parts of your face and just it does not dry your face uh it does not leave it dry so just go ahead and use a facial toner i use it on the pad cotton pad put it a little around uh it does not you know pores on its own which is great so just go ahead and shake it a little the amount you need super easy go ahead and tap it on your skin which i have done before tap it tap it tap it uh i found the you know the action of the toner right away it's like tinglish a little like you know getting all the ingredients into my skin uh after that your skin is totally prepared for the next step which would be either the serum or oil or hydrating cream which i have picked for you the mandarin facial hydrating thing which was also before that acidimide nice cinnamite acidamide super great for um you know to reduce hyperpigmentation uh redness as well soothe your pores if you have big pores um and in general um i have little breakouts right here after all the sweat because it's super hot outside so i really want to get rid of them uh which i am using the niacinamide for now and esop's facial toner has my cinnamon in one of the ingredients that's why i actually picked uh my cinnamon separately because i remember that it's a good ingredient so if you do not have you know spray guns as i do just use the toner and you're going to be just fine and after that i picked the hydrating cream from isa as well lovely this one has a little fragrance of lemon because it has a little of the lemon oil in lemon peel oil in it so very very mild so don't worry about the frequency here very mild but uh love love the texture love the way it acts on my skin um really likes that moisture inside so i'm gonna just go ahead and add a little more just stab onto your skin tap tap tap tap tap and uh yeah so my life is coming to attend unfortunately because i wouldn't be talking about each up forever love that brand uh super super super chic super grateful for the packaging and in general for using natural ingredients lots of oils um yeah so if you guys do not have any questions i'm gonna be saying goodbye and i'll see you tomorrow at 4 30. i am super appreciative of you know your comments and in general that um you know you're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQT4tVwRO6I,hey everyone it's Jen thanks so much for tuning in and watching my channel today I am going to do a review of one of my most recent purchases I went to the Nordstrom pop in it's like a little pop-up shop that they have at the Nordstrom in Chicago on Michigan Avenue so I went there because they had the line ESOP now it's not it looks nothing like how it sounds it's AE SOP so with the other day with my friend Maria and I kind of splurge a little bit but I have been wanting to know about these products for so long and you can only do so much research by looking on websites you don't know what things smell like how they are on your skin so super excited to purchase some well that's nice sorry about that if those join you so I have done some research for you so that maybe it'll help you make a decision on the products that you want to purchase I can tell you that first of all customer service people who work there were so helpful so nice and I ended up spending a lot of money which you know which I love beauty products so probably the strangest thing I picked up from there is their deodorant in this little package will spray up that way little spray there I can tell you the stuff smells amazing I actually ended up buying it because one of the sales people walked past me and I was like oh what perfume does she have on there like um that was her deodorant and then I thought well I want to smell like that deodorant so I went ahead and purchased it it has a bed of our root zinc I can't say that coriander seed yep and then the other things are in French this is an aluminum free deodorant so what that means is it's not an antiperspirant it is a geode arendt I am someone I don't really sweat that much so this is perfect for me so I've been using this for the past few days and it absolutely works it smells amazing I really want them to come out with a perfume some sort of body spray it smells like this please because it's really really good I don't not explain what this smells like you know what it smells like it smells like a spa that's exactly what it smells like what without your armpits it smell like a spa they can another thing I picked up is the Isabelle oil burner blend now this is something that you it says an invigorating and refreshing blend of spearmint sage and rosemary leaf oils ideal to scent any room when in need of vitality and clear thinking what does one vitality and clear thinking how'd you get this it's not that hard to sell me things my oil burner gets you tomorrow but I can tell you just after opening this cap you can really smell it it doesn't really do it justice when you smell it just out of the bottle hear what the girl did at the store was pour it into a bowl of water so I could smell it and it was really good it smells very clean it almost smells like spearmint gum but not in a cheesy way I think it'll be very refreshing it'll be nice to have in the room I'm looking forward to burning that which that sounds weird I got to make sure that this is closed I have a skincare routine that I do every day and it doesn't involve Esau products but I thought that it might be a nice time to incorporate one of them and one thing that I don't use right now which I know I should is is a toner so I thought I'd take a look at their toner and it is there B and T balancing toner so b4 vitamin B and it balances out your skin and the bottle is just simple and you actually just kind of pour it out onto your couple drops under your palm and then you like Pat it into your skin like you just like like that the girl told me to do you don't need a cotton pad for this one which I really like because there is no alcohol in it so it just bounces your skin it adds in the vitamins that you lose from washing it and it brings us back into your skin and I felt like that couldn't be a bad thing so I decided to get it they have a bigger size in this but I thought that this size was good enough for right now so the next thing I purchased from ESOP was their hand soap and body balm and there's a couple different scents one of them was just like not for me but these ones were so this one is let's start with the hand wash it is has mandarin Rhine rosemary leaf cedar atlas no idea what that is has orange there's a lot of good stuff in here it smells really good let me see if I can it definitely the orange scent definitely comes out in a very refreshing way hmmm it's like if you went to a spa and then someone peeled an orange that's what this smells like exactly what it smells like which smells amazing this is a gigantic bottle of it they I don't even know if they make a smaller one but you can see how big it is and I think it will last for a little while alright so here is the hand balm which whenever I hear the word balm like if I were buying this online I would think a balm is really thick and heavy and creamy and more of like a something to like fix dry skin this on the other hand is a normal hand lotion I've actually been using it on my upper body and how do I explain this okay this is a spa which apparently all of their products smell like spas this and I don't even know if this ingredients in here it smells like a spa plus lemon see if there's lemon in here interesting okay well oh it's not lemon it's mandarin it has mandarin rind rosemary cedar Alice okay this makes sense now the mandarin definitely comes across I smell citrus smell which is why I think I smelled the lemon before but I get the mandarin it smells very nice it's not too strong she's a nice refreshing scent and actually I know it says hand balm however if you read a little bit further on here it does say it is a readily absorb balm to effectively soften and hydrate hands cuticles and feet and in my case arms but I think this is going to be really great for the summer because it is not a super lightweight but it is like a medium to lightweight lotion which I prefer in the warmer months because I don't want anything really heavy on my skin and this is going to be perfect for that and I cannot wait to keep using it because it smells really really good so the people at ESOP were super friendly and I really enjoyed my entire experience experiencing actually a lot of their products I'm looking forward to trying more of the products in the future right now I have quite a few beauty products so these ones I wanted to incorporate I am excited because they just opened up a store in Chicago so when it's time for some new products I'm definitely going to go to the ESOP store because so far I am with their product line this is everything I hoped for and more so I hope you enjoyed this video and if you're thinking I've given you some products to try I suggest you do I can tell you that my friend Maria is very happy with their shampoo and conditioner that she purchased the other day with them so it seems like you can't really go wrong the team gave me a lot of samples so I can't wait to try those as well so thanks for tuning in and I will see you next time bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsrgZj4-q8,ryan concentrate body this is a moisturizer let me see it's cut off body i don't know what that says but you guys can see it but all this stuff so that one the rhine one i think smells a little bit like orange blossoms that's really nice and like especially smooth on your body um what else asop makes just like the most amazing stuff seriously like all those shampoos and conditioners are insane this is another one i really like and obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te1to4KyWvQ,oh my god you guys am i a bad mother my plants totally dying Oh oh my god alright maybe I should leave these outside so I can get better it needs sunlight hi you guys welcome back to another mask Monday so for today's video I'm very excited to be sharing with you guys this cleansing mask by a soap so this is the parsley seed mask I've been wanting to try this brand for so long finally they opened up a store near me so I was able to get my hands on this I remember seeing this brand for the first time on some of the dome bloggers IG and I really really wanted to try it so I'm so glad that I'm finally able to get my hands on this all right so I've already washed my face and I'm gonna go ahead and apply this so this is an Australian skincare brand is supposed to remove impurities and it's supposed to give you fresh skin the color is like this smells minty actually I really like the smell at first you know what I thought this mess would be a little thicker than this but it's not it blends really well on the skin I'm gonna go ahead and read the ingredients right after I buy this this my smells really good it's not just like good for the first minute and then it stinks after it's actually really good throughout and it feels so fresh I have a really bad habit of not layering on my products very thick because I feel like it wastes products that way so I do it very moderately and I love how it comes in this tube it's just aesthetically pleasing it looks like toothpaste and you can roll it up and I like it because you know when you have a bottle and you have leftover products underneath it's really hard for you to like scoop it up with this you can use it to the last drop and I really like that alright so moving on to the ingredients designed for frequent deep cleansing suit it to most skin types this mask removes impurities and refreshes the skin apply a thin even layer of mask over your entire face and neck okay so I did it right me trying to conserve products finally did something right allow to activate for up to 15 minutes before rinsing completely used twice a week there's a loan there there's fruit oil oils seed oil this leaf juice the mask is kind of tingly and I can feel that it's drying on my skin so if soap has over 80 formulations with their brand and it goes from skin care to hair care to body care you know what I really want to try their hair care I wonder if it would work well for my hair because I need a lot of hydration to my hair after damaging it and bleaching it for so many times this mask includes parsley seed evening primrose and rose hip seed sounds pretty good to me so this is kind of like a clay mask it feels like a clay mask it looks like a clay mask the purified clay mask is supposed to pull out any impurities and then the Rosoff and parsley seed is supposed to give your skin a big dose of antioxidants and it's supposed to perk it up so it's supposed to make it plumper plumpie or plumper plumper right if you have dry skin I know clay masks as a host you'll make your face kind of try this one is actually really hydrating I can feel it even though it's like tightening everything up with the aloe vera in there it helps your skin not feel so tight even though it's clay even if you have dry skin I would give this mask a chance it's really nice actually it feels really like refreshing as you guys can see it dries very blotchy and I feel like it's really showing all the problem areas of my skin especially in the t-zone area and my nose basically products became translucent in this area if you think a closer look you can see all of my pores it kind of magnifies the pores can you guys see that especially on my nose oh yeah and one thing that I noticed is that it does contain lavender and that's supposed to soothe and cool your face that's why you get such like a cooling effect plus the minty smell makes it really nice on your skin so at first it felt really tight as it was drying but now it kind of feels normal it doesn't feel as tight anymore I'm hoping this mask will make the inflammation from the acne smaller if not dissolve it completely that would be amazing I'm excited alright y'all I just washed off the mask that was the easiest mask to wash off by the way it kind of just came off a lot of the times when we do clay masks it's really hard it gets everywhere cuz there's a thick layer on your skin because this mask was so thinly put on it came off right away and I washed it off with warm water and then I kind of rinsed once again with cold water you're supposed to wash your face before masking with warm water kind of opens up the pores you mask let that soak in and then you rinse it off cool water will close the pores that way there's less impurities coming back into your skin after you mask only thing is there's no exfoliation to the mask so obviously you have to do your own exfoliation all right so after masking what you want to do is to apply a toner and then put your favorite moisturizer on and that's pretty much it you guys for my review on this product I actually really love this I like the fact that it's nice and cool and refreshing on the skin and even after taking it off it feels pretty nice and refreshed and clean and you apply a thin layer so this product will probably last me in fair long time for this tube you get about two point four ounce all right so this mask is priced at about $45 I think the other mass that I reviewed are lower in price but honestly I feel like this guy is worth it for $45 especially when you only use a little bit at a time so this is gonna last you a very long time there's a bunch of online shops that carry this brand norstrom I know carries this online I'm not sure if they have it in store but if you have a store near you I definitely check it out they're very known for their hand soaps also this is a go for me so let me know what you guys think of this mask and if you tried any other products that you would recommend list them in the comment below so I know to check it out thanks for watching guys and we'll see you guys next week bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHAHiMkU8Ck,hi welcome to my channel welcome to skincare design today i want to introduce the easel camellia nut facial hydrating cream to you guys um so this is a lovely cream comes in a glass container as well so not in a plastic container like the 500 ml products from esop and so i really love the plug the glass container if it's very high quality uh this one is in a 60 ml um size and i've used this for a bit now especially during the colder months when i just wanted to give my skin a little bit more hydration i've got a combination skin usually use the mandarine and facial hydrating cream but this one is a little bit thicker and yeah it's it's a lovely cream as you can see here it is a little bit thicker than the mandarin one and um feels a little bit like more buttery i would say um as you can see it looks you can see there's like a little bit um cream you can still see the cream like like sunscreen um because this is more thicker than the other one i really like this product i've got a combination skin i don't want to hydrate my skin too much but still i want to hydrate it or moisturize it so i use this when it's quite cold and want to give my skin um a little bit extra hydration it has got a very mud finish as you can see so my skin is not shiny or anything like it it's very much which i like i prefer a matte finish not a like a oily shiny or dewy finish or something like that so um this is quite nice it doesn't um so yeah it doesn't it smells it i don't know i can't really describe this this man it smells a little bit like common mile um yeah there's camomile as well in it smells a little bit like camomile the strong is not the smell it's not too strong so um yeah it's it's a good smell if you don't want to have a strong smelling moisturize on your face i would definitely recommend this uh smells also very only sex so not too feminine or anything which i like um yeah i would highly recommend this product honestly if you've got if you want to give your face a little bit more hydration more than the mandarin one and especially with the colder month i would definitely definitely recommend this product yeah um if you've got any questions please let me know in the comment box below thank you so much for watching and please don't forget to subscribe and to give me thumbs up thank you bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wqAgNdFDo&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,hey guys welcome back to my channel today i wanted to share with you a bunch of products that i picked up in a recent shop that i did at esop so it's a little bit of a haul because i was restocking a bunch of things around my home and the reason why i love these products and by the way these have all been bought with my own money they're not gifted i wish so the reason i really love them is because they're very aesthetic so they look really beautiful sitting around the house or displayed and i also am obsessed with their stores i think it's one of the best retail experiences because you kind of walk in they're all extremely unique and done by local designers which is something that is really cool for me being a designer myself and i think their product ethos is amazing there are a lot of natural ingredients they all smell beautiful the people in the store talk like this so you feel really calm and i just think it's amazing that they give you so many different samples and they've got anything from spf to skin care to just kind of little bits and pieces around the house so i'm going to show you through everything that i picked up and if you are new here just a super quick reminder don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and hit that subscribe button i put up new videos every single week now let's get into the first product my favorite product and i guess one that's a little bit on the cheaper side so if you were just kind of wanting it for aesthetic purposes then this is a really good place to start so that is the esop mouthwash so i'm not even going to try and pronounce it the way that they say it underneath but the flavors if you will in this is clove bud star anise and spearmint leaf this is so nice it's so so refreshing and it's not harsh like normal mouthwashes that i guess have a little bit of alcohol and things in it to really kill the bacteria this is more just like an oral hygiene kind of thing i think it's just like so you've always got fresh breath and i think the bottle is so beautiful it also did come with a little glass beaker on top but mine smashed unfortunately i think it was a little bit undersized for the bottle so definitely check that in the store before you take it home because the beaker would have been really nice and then it kind of covers like this plastic lid which is a little bit naff but i love this and i guess if you didn't want to be spending you know 25 or whatever on mouthwash you could probably just buy it once and then refill the bottle with whatever mouthwash you normally use so this is definitely one of my staple products and something that i honestly just keep going back and buying all the time the next product i really love from them and something that's really nice to have if you've got guests coming to stay and you want to put some little things on the end of their bed for them to have their own little products while they're staying with you is the cleansing bar so this is a body cleansing slab by esop and it is bergamot rind langlang and tahitian lime it smells so good and it really moisturizes your skin which i love so this is what it looks like it's literally just a baby soap bar and i just think this is so sweet it honestly it just smells amazing and i think it's a really really nice little gift to give to someone or just something really great to have in your shower because i know like often when you go to the shops and you buy a bar of soap it's enormous and i get that they're just trying to give you good value for money but i find if you leave a soap bar in the shower for too long it goes really manky and i end up wanting to throw it out which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a huge soap bar and having the big value in the first place so i really like this one because as you can see it's like smaller than the palm of my hand and i find that i actually just end up using and finishing the bar instead of wasting any of it the next product is also quite an affordable one from them and a definite essential given the whole situation we've just gone through this last year and that is hand sanitizer so i keep this one with me in my handbag and i also have one at work on my desk i hate really strong and harsh sanitizers i think you know when you go to the chemist or somewhere out and about and they ask you to sanitize your hands before walking into the store i have my own because i hate those ones that are super super strong and they almost like make your hands really dry as well i feel like my hands were just getting completely dried out after all of that so this one is called the resurrection rinse free hand wash and it's mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas whatever that is and it is an alcohol-based one as well so it is a proper hand sanitizer that will do the job and it just smells divine so this is another really great staple from esop so on the topic of dry hands that was something i really struggled with because i'm someone who loves to slather themselves in moisturizer so feeling like my hands were kind of getting attacked during the pandemic especially in winter which already ordinarily dries out your skin i wanted to get a hand balm so i got this one this is called the balm or balm aromatic and it just comes in this little tube which again you can just pop in your handbag so super convenient size it is the same kind of scents and ingredients as the hand sanitizer so it's mandarin rind rosemary leafs and cedar atlas and it's just a really amazing moisturizing hand balm i'll show you what some of it looks like sorry this is a new one so i've got to pierce the lid um but it's just this little yellow kind of colored um balm and it's quite thick without being like claggy i guess which is also really nice i don't like when you kind of put on hand bums and they're like i don't know a little bit too oily and stuff because then it sort of just feels a little bit gross and you end up wanting to wash it off now because i love that one so much i actually have it in the bigger size as well and this was initially bought because i just absolutely love the packaging of these tubes i've seen these things you can get where you can kind of like roll up the tube on a little metal thing um if you know where to buy those please let me know because i have no idea and it didn't come with one of those but that would be really really handy but like i said again it's the exact same ingredients this one is just the bigger size in this really cool looking tube and this is my one that i keep at home in my bathroom something that i use every single morning to wake me up before i go to the gym because i do a 6 a.m pilates class is this one and it's the immediate moisture facial hydrosol so this one is just like a little bit of a spritzing spray i guess if we were traveling i would definitely take this with me on the plane i feel like years ago when i was younger i would always just put on like a full face of makeup so i looked good on the plane and now these days i'm all about hydrating and moisturizing so i would be drinking a ton of water and putting on all of my skincare products and just making sure i arrive feeling really hydrated so this was something that i discovered a little while ago so this is rose petal bergamot peel and chamomile bud and it's an invigorating spray on hydration to relieve all skin types now i just love this i know but some people probably don't like the idea of being like spritzed in the face when you first wake up in the morning but for me i really like it and it's definitely um like a solid part of my morning routine i just really really enjoy it and i definitely feel like it wakes me up a little bit so i can get in the mood to work out now this is an old one and it has been floating around the bottom of my handbag so i aimed you to go and get it again and it's this lip balm so this is a really tiny little size one and it's kind of in a tube so this is a little bit um impractical i guess because it sort of just does this can you see what it's doing it's literally just like coming out of the tube so i probably will not buy this again because it does this every time and i have absolutely no idea why but it's so annoying and it weighs so much of the product but anyway this is called the rose hip c rose hip seed lip cream and it's rose hip seed to sephiral and langling and it's to hydrate your lips but i'm hoping that they've got one that's more just in like a i don't know like a little lip smacker looking kind of tube instead for lip balm because like i said that one was just a pretty bad purchase i think it would make a really cute gift but it's just not practical something i am definitely on board with now and i never used to be really good at using is spf so don't be like me go and get yourself an spf now i don't use the really really strong ones because this is my natural skin tone i actually haven't faked hands this week at all so i am a little bit more on the olive side i'm not super fair so i am able to get away with an spf 25 but i do believe they also have spf 50 as well so this one is the protective facial lotion and it's got green tea pantheral and sephoral and it is a broad spectrum sunscreen for daily use i love this it comes in a pump bottle and it's just the best formulation it's not too greasy or thick and it sits really well under makeup so that was an absolutely amazing find from them and it really wasn't too expensive compared to some other brands that i like like laroche posse and those kind of ones the last thing i want to show you was a definite splurge because i normally wouldn't want to spend this much on a daily facial moisturizer because of how quickly we obviously go through these kind of products but it's this one called the seeking silence facial hydrator and this is my sort of like not everyday moisturizer i would say i just put this one on when i'm not wearing makeup because i don't want to waste it by like potentially not actually soaking in under makeup so this one is squalane ginger root and bizabalol whatever that is absolutely no idea it's a lightweight hydrating fluid formulated to bring a sense of calm to sensitive skin now you may have noticed in some videos occasionally that i suffered from a bunch of breakouts on my forehead so last year i was actually hospitalized i had high grade cervical dysplasia so that was quite stressful and if you haven't got a pap smear recently this is your sign please please book yourselves in and always get checked regularly because i do and i did at the time and that is exactly how they found it out for me but what happened after that operation was i think all of my hormones and things in my body just went completely whack and i suffered from really bad breakouts on my forehead that were almost like acne actually and i've never had that in my life i've always been quite blessed to have clear skin so i really really needed to find a bunch of sensitive products hence going to esop because a lot of their stuff is really geared towards very sensitive skin and it's a really light touch so that was the moisturizer that i selected and that was really just to help me get my skin hydrated again and to kind of not cause any further irritation and really really calm down a lot of the redness and things that i was suffering from at the time so yeah i think it was really really good product for that it was very effective but it was pretty expensive i think it was 65 or something for that teeny tiny tub so up to you if you want to spend that much on a moisturizer if you're looking for a really luxe shopping experience and a great product then i would but yeah so that is it for my esop haul these are all my favorite products if you guys have any others that i am yet to discover then please leave them down in the comments below i would love to check them out the other range that i did really like is the parsley seed ones but i just haven't got around to going in and shopping for them because i'm trying to be a little bit budget conscious at the moment so that is it for today's video thank you guys so much for watching and i will see you next time bye you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Iv9SOTEo8U,Aesop Ptolemy candle and that is this big white one right here let me grab it it's lit we gotta be careful okay so it's a very minimalistic white candle it says Aesop there I hope you can see and I have it lit it has a little quote on the back that says no ages too early or too late for the health of the Soul so um Vera shark sells a few different Aesop candles this is the Tommy one again you can see it on your screen right now I feel that too so um I love that each candle has a different little quote on it um so definitely check them out not just this one but the others this one's kind of more of a Musky scent to it and I love that it's very like nighttime smell um so I love to have as many candles as possible but especially like high quality thank you so much we are both glowing I'm glowing because it's a little hot in this bathroom I'll be honest but um I love to have as many candles as humanly possible around the bath so this is a great one to have it's just I love how simple it is some candles are toxic and not great I won't mention any names but some of those big corporations that sell like all the candles that people love they're not the best for you you want to buy you know high quality candles they can cost you a little more but they do burn a lot better and lasts you longer typically depending like of course if you buy a tiny one maybe not but the higher quality the candle the better it is for you if you think about it you're breathing in the air you want to be you know good for you especially when you're trying to like relax and have a a nice bath and feel healthy and good about it you don't want you know you just want good ingredients around you which everything that we're going to talk about today has so that is the Aesop candle that I love I'm excited to try other scents from them like I had said bear shop has a few others um someone asks what makes candles toxic versus not basically you just want to make sure a lot of fragrance is not is not great um sometimes it can be okay but some people use sense not people but some candles will use synthetic ingredients or ingredients that you know obviously go into the air when you light the candle and you want to make sure like soy candles are great that's not based with something not natural um you don't want any chemicals you know you want the natural candle and that is what this is which I love so definitely look into that before you buy a candle and see you know the ingredients are all sound next we are going to talk about some products from this set let me share it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7tTL-nXbes,beneath the signature amber colored bottles text Heavy packaging and physical stores that each look like something out of an architectural Digest Magazine is a brand that's been around since 1987. so we're getting some people in the office to use the brujiest 40 hand wash and getting their thoughts pulled in another tribute okay so I'm just gonna get you to wash your hands with this this is Celine she's from Germany wow what that was so unexpected it has like grainy stuff in it what is it called it's like exfoliating oh yeah exfoliating sorry I'm German he has a fellow Aussie quite nice it's not too abrasive here's Colin I just found him it feels really good I didn't even expect this this is really like taking me to a new place I've never been before as far as hand soaps this is Brandon I feel like this is a most serious hand washing experience than what I generally have and it smells good too not just a normal hand soap I would go with you can buy a hand soap normally I don't mean I don't maybe one or two dollars tell me what you think this costs maybe 30 to 50 bucks okay you would actually be right there's just something so satisfying in products that are designed classically simply and traditionally whether you care for bougie high-end soaps hand bombs or even perfumes there is one brand Within These ranks that have actually been producing skin care since its Inception about three decades ago and I'm sure you've seen it and if you're not convinced even Haley Biebs is on board as Nano likes to make them in the cupcake tin no not the muffins yep right there that's why today we're gonna be exploring ESOP like do people come in and say it differently people say ASAP all the time the brand is called Esau is and they've managed to stay ahead of the trends while remaining largely silent subscribe so my curiosity actually started about a month ago when I was back home in Australia and I realized walking around that their Pinterest like aesthetic Spa stores no two of them were the same they were all uniquely different from the marble sinks to the brass tapware and all their clean shelves oh my God kiss and when covid hit it was a time when everyone was really concentrating on hand hand washing which propelled their already cult favorite hand wash even further to become mainstream especially for people who wanted a little bit of self-care so that it wasn't just a chore to wash our hands it was more of an experience a new life pleasure if you will and don't underestimate our humble hands because the hand washing Market was worth 2.5 billion in 2020 but that's projected to be doubled and worth about 5 billion your hand is like the closest thing to your face skin that's why we do everything like on the back yeah even when we try skincare we put it on the back of your hand and now we're going to wrap your hand thank you thank you yay this is like the best part of a manicure too yes exactly but it's not just all about our hands right what else did this brand do to turn mainstream while keeping so humble and it all started in Melbourne Australia when a hairdresser by the name of Dennis perfidas began mixing essential oils into hair products because he realized how bad the ammonia in these hair dye products smelt so you wanted to alleviate and make it more of a pleasurable experience as people were getting their hair done if you've never seen their products you might have recognized some of this since and is probably in some combination of Rosemary citrus peel Bergamot or even cedar because all the products within the ESOP brand are formulated with essential oils and the formulations combine both natural and lab made ingredients that are known for their earthy and herbal scents let's now look a little bit into the aesthetic starting from the bottle the black and white lettering between alternating black and cream solids is pretty ident defiable from miles away they use minimalistic wording using the fonts helvetica and Optimum medium and the macron die critic which is this straight bar over the E on the label lets you know that it's pronounced ESOP so even from this it's kind of a brand that's like if you know you know now before we get into my review let's talk about price in an interview with Dennis where he was asked about the price of the hand bomb he was basically unperturbed critics are at the Liberty to use other products there's no justification required we make exceptional products with great care and attention so there you go that's badass because he's just super confident about the quality of his products you might have even noticed that they don't really do marketing like you haven't seen them on billboards buses you haven't really heard from them from influences so what do they actually do to get their name out there it really is just through organic word of mouth so to get into the mood of the hall let's go and spray my living room and then we'll continue that foreign [Music] so I got my hands on about 10 new products from the ESOP line all in different categories from skincare to mouthwash toothpaste serums and so I want to let you know which ones I think are worth spending the money on which ones if you haven't tried anything from them you might want to explore and which ones maybe are just worth the skip okay so let's start on I guess the cult favorite which is the hand wash or the bomb like the body bomb or the hand bomb I have the reverence aromatic hand wash this is actually one of the two main lines of their hand wash products each of them go for forty dollars each and it's in this 16.9 fluid ounce or 500 mL so I know 40 dollars is pretty steep for you know a hand wash if you compare it to a lot of other brands in this range like LA labo or even by radio forty dollars actually sits snugly in the middle because I know buy radio sells ones for like 60 something dollars the labo has like a hand soap that goes for 55 this is the reverence as I said and I actually prefer this over the cult favorite the resurrection aromatic hand wash and this is actually the version that contains finely milled pumice so this one does have that physical exfoliation property which I really love because it's like that extra like luxury at home or spa-like experience that you can recreate at home some people might not like you know the exfoliating properties every single day or using it every time they wash their hands so I'd say this is also a great like alternative to having other soaps and hand washes and I won't go for this all the time so in that respect I can see why this isn't like a necessity but if you want to go for more of that everyday hand wash I would suggest that you can find the ones without the pumice stone so I really love this one it is the reverence and I actually had no idea what reverence really meant so I Googled it and it is defined as deep respect expect for someone or something which I love I just find it really does make a difference when you know you're washing your hands and you're like and you're really like in tune with what you're smelling how it's making you feel as a practice of presence so moving on the next thing I picked up in the store was the Lucent facial concentrate so when I picked it up off the shelf I looked at the ingredients it's got rose petals sodium ascorbal phosphate and niacinamide so from this we know it's a vitamin C and niacinamide serum designed to balance combination as well as oily skin types the most exciting thing for this room is that I realized and solidified while it was in Australia that I think I react to Ill ascorbic acid because two or three times that I've tried a new vitamin C serum I instantly get like really irritated itchy and I have a rash like a low-key rash for about two weeks for it to fully disappear so so then right at the end of my trip was when I got this and I'm like okay I'm gonna try a derivative of vitamin C to see if it still happens and I didn't break out I didn't get a face rash I didn't get irritated it wasn't drying and I can tell you I love it so the serum is this really lightweight gel consistency then I looked into the ingredients and found that it actually does have an extract of red algae which is called sodium carrageenan and then the finish of it was that it left my face feeling like a little bit tacky and then I fanned it out a little bit and then it just like really dissolved into my skin to become more of this like satin to like semi mattifying almost but really hydrated people hate on essential oils all the time but me being a person with sensitive skin I actually found that this worked better than like other ingredients that aren't formulated with so it just goes to show so it depends on the oil it depends on your skin it depends on everyone what I don't love is the price it's a hundred and twenty dollars and I'm like whoa okay that's that's pretty expensive but I would say if I think about it people are selling vitamin C serums for more than a hundred dollars anyway those vitamin C's might be saying that it's pure ill ascorbic acid which is why they can charge high for it because it's you know the the source of vitamin C but then to me now I'm like I can't even use those products anyway next is actually a kit so in the store when we were browsing they had these like boxes so there was two there was an arrival and a departure and because I was about to leave back to New York I was like you know what the departure sounds good and actually it was far superior to the arrivals I would say because it comes with seven different products either a mini sized or full sized so this is a great way I feel feel like if you want to try a bunch of their products without committing to full size can I tell you this kit is a 10 out of 10. you get a lip product there's a toothpaste there's a hydrating mask which is like a moisturizer there's the resurrection aromatic hand balm in the small version then they have a rinse free hand wash Perfection mouthwash even more Perfection and this immediate moisture facial hydrosol which is a facial Mist I first want to start off with this blue chamomile facial hydrating mask whoa whoa whoa this is essentially like a hydrating overnight mask you can use it two ways using it as a 30 minute mask and then you wipe the excess off and just like Pat the rest in or you can use it as like your moisturizer to sleep overnight and then wash it off in the morning what it contains is niacinamide sodium carrageenan which is that red algae again and bisibal which is the blue chamomile we've heard of bitterball in a lot of soothing calming like Korean formulated skincare products Lord knows everyone who's been on a long distance flight has come off the plane with five new pimples cracked skin you're just dehydrated you're like cops and it's just not cute so before the flight I went into the bathroom washed my face did my whole routine using the hydrate uh the hydrosol facial Mist as well as this I kid you not when we arrive back in New York got off the plane even Thomas was like your skin looks great something of that form I was like still half asleep but I was like what and then I went to the toilet looked in the mirror and I was like oh my God I only applied this once throughout the time from Taiwan back to New York and my skin was actually plump and it looked like you know when you first wake up your Skin's like a little bit puffy but it looks really smooth and it's really like plump that was actually how my skin looked using this and that was the first time I've ever stepped off a plane and had that feeling normally I'm itchy I have a bajillion pimples my T-Zone is all over the place and then I have to recover for the next five days so I was like whoa if you're looking for a soothing calming overnight mask that can do it like okay so let's talk about the hydrating Mist next it's called the immediate moisture facial hydrosol this one is a beautiful scent once again like more of that earthy woodsy Rosy scent I would say this one is not a standout in my view because I've used a bunch of really like great facial Mist like I enjoy the quarterly one more because it has that layer of like essential oil oils and it did the job of toning my face hydrating my face prepping my face pairing up these two on the flight but I don't think I'll be repurchasing this one so the next thing quickly is the resurrection aromatic hand bomb remember I was saying that they have reverence and Resurrection for the hand wash and hand bomb this is just the small one of the Resurrection the consistency of the hand bombs are so great because it's not too thick it's also not sticky which I really despise I don't like anything that's actually overly thick and hydrating for a handbag um it was the best duo that came with the rinse free hand wash that they have so this is also the resurrection rinse free hand wash so see what I mean where they produce multiple products within the same Aroma line so these two are like a matching pair and it's got the same notes you can buy this for ten dollars individually as well if you need it didn't leave a sticky feeling it wasn't like overly aromatic or smell like alcohol you know sometimes a lot of them smelling alcohol much more subtle than the hand cream so if you're going for something where you want people to smell your hands as you move it around then hand cream is the way to go but um the hand wash is a nice subtle scent that eventually Fades and it doesn't leave any sort of residue on your hand so you feel nice fresh and clean another thing that I got convinced through this was actually twofold so once at the store Thomas is a fan of mouthwash he loves you know Crest mouthwash any sort of mouthwash he uses it every day and I'm like you are not putting that on the bathroom counter so when we went in there I was like oh there's a mouthwash do you want to try it and he's like yeah okay so he tries it gives me a cup as well and then I tried it and I was like oh my God and then the departure kit actually has a mini mouthwash how considerate this is just like more fresh than it is painful I would say other ones are kind of like painful and burning you know oral hygiene is a thing I went to the dentist for the first time in six years I'm not proud of it and I realized that I had a bunch of cavities and I might need to take out all four of my wisdom teeth and I was like modified this is your reminder to floss every day so I would highly recommend you go to the ESOP store and try their mouthwash okay the last two things is a lip product as well as a toothpaste so let's start with the Cedar and citrus lip self so this is nice because your lips are perpetually parched even if you're like me and they're not normally dry they're dry on the plane let me tell you the ingredients for this one is grapefruit rind Ceda Atlas and orange rind this is really interesting it's like a gel oil lip product or like lip ointment and it's not thick and I've been using this before I go to sleep and it just keeps it nice and supple and it actually smells Divine it gives your lips more of a glossy finish compared to you know your typical lip balm but I will say that it wears off faster than like your like thick beeswax type of bombs so just depending on what it is that you want although the oil really does hydrate I don't know among other things if I would repurchase this one but for me it's a nice to have and very enjoyable to use because it's not sticky last thing is this toothpaste if you don't know mint is added into toothpaste just to give you that psychological feeling that you're fresh and clean right but it doesn't actually do much other than the feeling of moment it feels like a really clean toothpaste it doesn't foam and froth like another Colgate or like Crest you know typical toothpaste does but it just like cleans the teeth and gums and still has that minty freshness but just subdued and subtle so if you're into like clean toothpastes or the feeling of kind of like clean toothpaste I feel like this is something that you actually might enjoy so I would say if you're traveling guys try and get this departure kit next is also in the Wheelhouse of like aromatherapy it's the ginger flight therapy so this is essentially a roll-on like aromatic oil it's got ginger root lavender and geranium so I thought this would be just a fun purchase more than anything it's got the effects of soothing mentally and what you do is just roll this onto all your pulse points like you can put it on your temple your neck your wrists and from those areas that generate heat it will help like I don't know have that Aroma around but I have been using this uh since we got back at night because I'm still jet lagged and I can't sleep at night and I'm wide awake at 4am and so hasn't been able to put me to rest not really but I do feel calm it's also great to have in the office just as kind of like your pick-me-up as well if you need a little reset so I would say my top three items that I would recommend would be these three the reverence aromatic hand wash the facial concentrate with vitamin C and niacinamide as well as the uh blue chamomile facial hydrating mask those are so awesome so the story of Aesop to me really tells of staying in your lane producing products that are high quality and regardless of Trends in popularity doing what feels right to you because if it's truly something good that will speak for itself and this is a metaphor that we can apply to just about everything from people around us to situations we face and everything that we interact with like our favorite products hope you guys enjoyed this episode and if you like this format let us know what you would like to see below give it a like give it a thumbs up and if you've just joined the beauty within family thank you and more to come soon see you in the next one perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4-R4crYAp0,good afternoon boys and girls and welcome to episode 95 of love at first cent with me Purcell is coming to you as always live from YouTube I'm going to do the usual down here and make sure that everything is coming through fine on the tablet and the first comment today goes to Keith thank you very much for tuning in teeth welcome the the plan for today is that we are going to be doing two episodes two single perfume episodes no interviews or anything like that today and the first perfume that we're going to be looking at is this one here brand-new from ESOP the the Australia based brand and then when this episode is over we'll give YouTube a few minutes to do its thing as per usual and finish processing the video and then we will come back with something that I think a lot of you have been waiting for a brand new release sort of from adalaj and you will see what I mean when we do when we come back for episode 96 but anyway we should we should start with this one so as I'll go through the things that I always say thank you very much for tuning in please consider subscribing to my channel if you haven't already done so please give the video likes and thumbs up and heart etc etc please consider supporting my work on coffee to those of you who are continuing to support my work there thank you very very much indeed all of your support is deeply deeply appreciated if you're watching live feel free to ask a question leave a comment if you're watching the recording please feel free to ask a question leave a comment I try to get through to all of the comments and it's sooner rather than later okay let's start smelling now ESOP isn't is an interesting brand it might be it would be interesting for me to find out how many of you out there have actually tried anything from eSAB because as as a brand they've been around for several decades and they are mostly known as I'm sure you are aware for their for their skincare for their bath products vitaliy is saying good afternoon from summer-ish Stockholm well the South of England is very very summer issue at the moment and it I suppose what's admirable about esop is that they haven't released a vast number of perfumes they seem to take their time their perfume releases they are probably still best known for this one here for Marrakech this is the intense version of Marrakech that I got really really love it it's it's a it's a very simple perfume but it's fantastic for all of its simplicity it's just one of the best spicy perfumes I can think of you know there's a sort of spices that you may have in your imagination going down an Arabian soup an Arabian spice market and now this is this is the the latest one coming out very very soon and it's called ROH zoom I think that's how you're supposed to pronounce it I have had an initial sniff of this one so this isn't a proper sort of love at first sand but just an initial sniff and I have to say I was very quietly impressed and I'm not ignoring the comments by the way keep the comments coming and then we will I will read them can you see that bear okay right so there is something about this entire range about the entire ESOP range and I guess it ties in with their aesthetic that always comes across as very convincingly natural as you know regular viewers of this channel will know and regular readers of personalized comm will know that I have absolutely nothing against synthetics per se you know modern perfumery wouldn't exist without synthetics and all natural perfumes without the support of some of the synthetics actually usually tend not to smell all that wonderful um but what we want is the illusion of naturalness in perfumery a lot of the time don't we even if we're smelling something that we know couldn't possibly exist in nature we wanted to smell real we somehow wanted to smell convincing we don't want it to smell like it's come out of a vat of chemicals unless of course that was the perfumers intention but you know we park that to one side and this one again like the others from this range does feel as though it has organically sprung from a natural world so in that sense it it very much is in keeping with with the aesthetic and and as you would expect from the name its rosy but you know I'm thinking of the roses that I've got growing just a few meters away and in the garden this is this is very much an interpretation of a rose I don't think there is a rose out there in nature that would smell exactly like this because this isn't a smell that is especially soft or delicate even though it's not harsh either but I guess what I'm trying to get at is that it doesn't have those typical rose cliches you know it's not it's not powdery milky creamy even though those facets are there it doesn't feel like a rose solid floor it's not one of those perfumes where the perfumer is trying to give you the impression that they've just poured a rose essence into a bottle this and I think the clue comes from this is a sort of little press material image that's come with the sample this is a very very telling clue because actually if you could imagine a rose grafted onto an image like this this is what this smells like it's quite dark it's it's quite woody and maybe a little bit boozy but certainly not overpoweringly so I think maybe I'm thinking boozy because of a sort of alcoholic drinks that you would associate with with woody notes and there is there is a pepperiness to it but but and and also surprisingly actually an element of just a touch for intrigue and for contrasts of sweetness something that you might expect from like a rose cordial if for those of you who've tried a rose cordial in a real proper Rose cordial but it's it's mostly quiet it's mostly subdued it's funny and and and I was saying this I'm sure just the other day on it on ER on a video the the kinds of impossible images that perfumery is able to create this perfume does that creates one of these impossible images as well because it's like a rose but a rose in monochrome like this image is suggesting and if you can imagine a black and white rose a rose filtered through bracket black and white it would kind of smell like this so I'm thoroughly thoroughly intrigued and when I had an initial sniff of this just yesterday or a couple of days ago I thought oh this definitely requires a revisit I wasn't paying a special attention to it I had a feeling that maybe it didn't last as long as some of something you know some some people may want their perfumes to last but it wasn't a problem it was it's really really interesting and the name obviously reminded me of the Vero current perfume rosey and actually even the scent somehow ties in with vero Kern's idea of a twisted rose and unexpectedly dark rose right let's let's see how this blotter does and obviously because we are smelling a new perfume there is going to be a blotter update very very quickly for those of you who don't know what that is because I insist and so should you the we cannot judge perfumes on first impressions a few hours after the initial broadcast in the video description I a few lines to say how the perfume actually developed on the blotter or if I wore it on skin how it developed on skin because we need to give perfumes a chance to develop especially if there is interesting and intriguing and and compelling is this one so comments have been coming through who have I missed Isaac says just discovered your channel today enjoying your videos a lot thank you very much it's a support from Hong Kong that's very very kind thank you Valerie says hello and good morning from Texas hi Thomas says hello from a rainy town in the south of Poland oh well we'll send you some sunshine unless of course you like the rain and races good afternoon from Manchester Umberto's in the south of Sweden Sabra says good morning from Seattle thanks for tuning in and a newbie Annette says watching from Oakland andy says hi from Edinburgh a big fan of ESOP products although pricey yes this is this is not cheap I think this is something in the region of 130 pounds although I'm not sure whether that's for this size Erik says I love Marrakech yeah so do I and Nico says hi from Greece Katinka is that how you say your name is says greetings from Romania and Johnny says I'm from Alabama Spina masters good afternoon from London drinking a strong cup of joe hotels and Umberto's telling us that he is wearing java sulit wha bottle from Paris says Chang Dhruva Seungri's from Arkansas again wearing patema tar on one hand and Acqua di Parma colonia club on the other oness interesting combination let's look at the press material for a rose ooh it's very brief where have I got it where have I got it okay here we go because this is interesting Aesop's for that fragrance it says rose ooh Oda para was inspired by the celebrated French modernist designer Charlotte pareil who was deeply committed to improving the lives of others through intelligent functional design DeLeon was both resolutely of the machine age while remaining sympathetic to handcrafted techniques and natural materials equally rosu embodies its own subtle olfactory paradoxes bringing together warm complex florals and metallic highlights of green citrus and wood metallic I suppose so maybe something but I just keep thinking dark woods the fragrance was formulated in partnership with long term eSAB collaborator Barnaby feel every facet of rosu embodies a link to parry owns life and work textural opening notes allude to the rose created in her honor by Japan's libera nursery in consultation with her daughter / met Parian barsac in tandem the crisp notes of shiso referenced the bracing Alpine environments she explored at every opportunity there is very something very Japanese actually about the aesthetic of ESOP isn't there a heart of contempt sorry complimentary florals spices and guaiac would speak to her nature that was both tender and tenacious powdery base notes are very very extract patchouli and myrrh recall the men's cologne she customarily wore and yes if we're being stereotypical there is something quite masculine about this smell dr. Kate Forbes Aesop's director of innovation says with a rose ooh we have again explored alternative techniques in order to achieve an intense highly nuanced fragrance that brings a new category to the ESOP range it's a pleasure and a privilege to work with Barnum atheon once more and to express our shared esteem for Sherlock Parian through this remarkable formulation and then they say that the perfumer is also the perfumer behind Marrakesh intense that the perfume whose name I still don't know how to say is a will who will and Aesop's collection of aromatic room sprays and he worked closely with the Pirelli on family spending time at Mario's loft apartment in Paris and travelling to Japan with her daughter and her husband the photographer Jacques Barsac and I believe that I know it doesn't say who this photo is by but it says copyright archives Charlotte fel Charlotte Helens life spanned almost the entirety of the 20th century from 1903 to 1999 her work was influenced by her extensive travels her egalitarianism a love of the elemental outdoors and above all modernism and I just want to make sure the size yes this is the 50 mils and this in the UK is going to retail at 133 pounds for 50 mils is definitely on the on the on the expensive side but you know let's not have that debate today how have I done for comments hello from the home of esop is says Linda joy in Melbourne Australia yes absolutely you're right it is Melbourne and not just Australia Hideko says I would love to hear you review Luba up a tent for her I would love to as well I haven't got a sample though and Drago says hello from Romania so how is this doing so far it intriguing is the word and I think it's fantastic that they've chosen that image because something about you know something about the texture of the wood there the fact that you can see the Rings Deline delineated so clearly there's something you know that this isn't this isn't just sort of ordinary monochrome is it there's something a little bit washed out about this black and white a little bit bleached and and this perfume feels faded but in a really intriguing way it's almost like the perfumery equipped equivalent of looking at a faded photograph it does evoke the past in Atlanta and I suppose if they were thinking of trying to pay homage to the work of a designer who was active for as for as long as this particular designer was then then they maybe would want to have created haunting that's the word a perfume with a haunting quality and there's something haunting about this image and there's something haunting about this rose that is just out of reach and you think it's going to be an ordinary rose but actually then it sort of grafts itself onto a tree or you know ties ties itself around a bark really really interesting and the spices are really interesting too and anti in quite neatly with with Marrakech intents so certainly intrigued and first scent and I will be wearing this again to see how it develops okay that brings this short and sweet episodes to an end like I said stick around because after about five minutes after YouTube has finished doing its thing we will come back with a brand new release from and wash so see you in a few minutes bye [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z4ICtaeVUE,today we have a review of this the rock and shave serum from ESOP is it fabulous that's that's really a bad pun I'm sorry about that welcome to the majestic shaver channel well we'd love to talk about the tools the technique and tradition of classic wet shaving we're here today with another product review on this item right here it's the shaving serum from ESOP let's talk first about what you get with the ESOP shaving serum you get two ounces now I'm not exactly sure how many shades that'll get you you'll see as we do the video I started off with doing kind of two pumps of the shave serum and then later on I had to add a little bit more as I wanted to do my second pass now one of the thing that is noteworthy is as a shaving serum it's not a soap it's not a cream definitely but the idea is that it is translucent it's clear it's basically low foaming so who is that ideal for well I think if you really want to do some nice detail work maybe you have a beer lineup that you're trying to do maybe you're concerned about your sideburns or you're trying to line up something like a goatee then something like this is going to give you a lot more visibility so that's the basic idea with the shaving serum low Foam high visibility and as I mentioned on the packaging they're looking for a really slick finish and so that's what they're trying to sell you on the idea of rather than high cushion like you might get with a luxurious soap or shave cream that the slickness of this actually makes up for it and regarding to the ingredient it's pretty interesting i'll read the ones that i can pronounce again i want to mention that esau if you look on their website and the promotional marketing materials they really try to highlight that natural company so when they put in this well they start out with water aloe barbadensis in that correctly Barbados leaf juice there is also coke amine oxide glycerin which we always like to see for a good collide the thing that's a little bit puzzling actually is I've only read some of the ingredients they appear to be about twenty different ingredients a number of them with a high amount of syllables so when I read something like that that doesn't weigh skew or say to me a really natural product I mean you can pair that with something like the craftsman soap company or Hawaiian shaving company when you look at their list of ingredients their list of ingredients is much more simple and often much more recognizable but I don't know maybe they're she's doing scientific names for natural things so maybe will give me a bit of a pass now in regards to the scent this is listed as having a sandalwood and Roli blossom scent I really don't know what neroli is supposed to do something I like if you have an idea go ahead and put it in the comments below I have a familiar with sandalwood it's sort of one of those classic men's shaving a grooming cents that have been around for a really long time and I do want to say that the scent on this is very pleasant it's actually one of my favorite things about this particular product it's definitely got the sandalwood stamp but I find whatever that neroli blossom is whatever it is it's supposed to smell like it does sort of broaden the appeal of the sandalwood it's not just one note and the scent is strong I mean even after you shave you'll be aware that the scent is there so let's go ahead and move on to a little bit of shaved footage shouldn't close the cat out let's try it head again let's go ahead and move on to a little bit of shape footage I do want to mention that in my my other videos we've done the lathering test we let you see how to respond to the brush again the whole idea of the ESOP shave serum is that it's low foaming so you're not really gonna get anything out of that I do want to mention I've tried a couple of different ways to use this shaving serum I've gone straight to the skin which is basically what they recommend and what I did with the video when I've gone straight to the skin I have not had a lot of success of building up any kind of foam even Lowe foam so what I did for the video is I actually kind of agitated a little bit more with a shaving brush so let's go onto the shaving footage so you'll notice here in the shaving footage that just like I mentioned it's a very low foam product my skin was well hydrated I just gotten out of the shower a few minutes before and I just kind of work it up a little bit with the brush where this particular shave is I'd like to do with all my shame and reviews I just used the product itself I didn't use any pre-shave oil no pre-shave soap so what you're seeing here is just the results with the shave serum itself for the sake of variety I use my Portland razor company a hydro straight razor which I just love and then on the other side of my face I did use my 1954 Gillette SuperSpeed with a Bosch quad blade and new voshkod blade now you might know the SuperSpeed is pretty mild so I really wanted it to test it out this prime feature of this shaving serum is supposed to meet the glide and they will say that particularly with a straight razor it does provide a very nice Glide the challenge is because it's so low visibility it's so low foam sometimes it's hard to know exactly where you still have product but it does for straight razor make that glide very nicely and I didn't really experience any irritation with the straight razor you want coming in different angles or going slightly against the grain across the grain now strangely enough with my safety razor and if you're familiar with the safety razors you'll know that a 1954 Gillette is a pretty mild shaving head it's not a dress or highly efficient in any way and I had a lot of success with the Bosch quad blades but I did feel like I got a little bit of irritation when I was using the safety razor with the shaving serum now that could be just because I've gotten a little bit out of that habit of shaving with a safety razor at probably about 90% of my shave these days with a straight razor but it is very nice to have that visibility so sometimes those areas where it can be easy to miss around the nostrils around the corners of the mouth you can really see what areas you need to go up and touch up between my first and second pass I did feel like it dried up on me a little bit and even a couple times in the shape itself I was surprised how fast is shaving assume it's kind of start to dry out a little bit and I'd have to go back and put a little bit more water on my face I just was surprised because I move pretty quickly now with a straight razor from different parts of sections to my face obviously with the safety razor you can move quickly and so I didn't expect that but I just did a two pass shave kind of with and against the grain the results were fine now the post shave well it was pretty good not great but nothing felt dry things still felt slick still felt moisturized and filled any burn at all and then on top of that that scent which I liked so much it was still there still present kind of lingering on the skin this brings us to the final portion of the video would I recommend the ESOP shave serum there are definitely some things to recommend the scent is amazing and spot-on the shape performance is pretty good and again if you're looking for something that provides a lot of visibility for lining up sideburns and goatees and part of your beard this could be exactly what you're looking for but there's one major reason why I just can't recommend the shave serum and that is this 2 ounces of the ESOP shave serum go for about fifty three dollars I've looked at a number of different websites 53 dollars to be a fairly consistent price that is very high-priced and in my opinion overpriced for the actual performance of the shave serum itself especially when you compare to other options that are on the market I mean artisan all natural shade soaps from places like craftsman soap company Phoenix shaving Hawaiian shaving company I mean those are going for a maximum about $14.95 to put that in perspective and we're talking about more than three times more for the ESOP shave serum and I just don't think that the actual of shape performance and post shave really justified that kind of price again if you've got a high Shay budget it's something you might want to try but for most of us out there I think our money is best spent elsewhere thank you very much watching the video I hope you enjoyed it if so please consider hitting that like and subscribe button right down there we look forward to seeing you next time and until then shave happy [Music] the shaving serum from ESOP is it Aesop's foibles Aesop's poly mm-hmm is it free no just no stop cut guys just don't don't ever let me try to do that kind of thing again please
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3o30l67CEa4&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvaltinhojota.com.br%2F&feature=emb_imp_woyt,hey everyone talking about karst by aesop this is basically a high-end woodsy aquatic not high-end in the sense that it smells necessarily fancy or you know definitely not try-hard in any way but just that it's higher quality better ingredients and just a little bit smoother and more refined than the typical one in this genre so the notes in this are juniper pink pepper bergamot rosemary sage human vetiver sandalwood and cedar normally when i see cumin as an ingredient in a fragrance i run the other direction or prep myself really hard before trying it it's almost gotten to the point where if i see it even when i'm looking in food ingredients it's like oh my god oh wait no okay i'm cool with that in basmati rice but i just do not have a good association of it with fragrance it can make people smell it's well known for me smelling like bo or just not good on a lot of people's skin i don't i rarely test that on skin because i don't really want to experience it but in this case i'm happy to say that it does not have that effect at all it opens with a very fresh lightly woodsy lightly spiced refined kind of thing to the point where i was thinking why are people comparing this to aquatics this doesn't smell aquatic at all you know i was confused looking at free granica how this reminds me of section type of thing but after about five minutes yep there it is so then it becomes this very maybe more marine than aquatic i would say it's not dewy watery or anything like that but it's kind of it's salty and almost like driftwood marine ocean kind of way really refined from like the rosemary and vetiver add this nice quality to it that feels more mature not in age way but just nice uh the sandalwood cedar keep it definitely woodsy but for some reason looking at these notes you might not think oh this would have this would be marine aquatic but it really is maybe there's other stuff that they're not mentioning but whatever it is that's what it ends up smelling like it is 195 for a 50 ml given the quality of the ingredients i don't think that's unfair if i was just going off the smell i have to say i feel like that would be kind of a price because yes this it does smell higher quality than the typical one but it really doesn't smell that far off by the time it gets to the dry down of a lot of other woodsy marine type scents out there but if that's a genre that you like and you've mainly just tried designers and haven't found one that kind of really feels like quality because a lot of those tend to smell kind of sometimes immature or cheapy side but this could satisfy that for you i'll put a link in the description where you can buy a bottle or a sample and yeah if you know you don't like woodsy aquatics or mean sense i wouldn't even bother checking it out but if you do this is a really high quality take on it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFgcSNN46dc&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,oh god I've got so many spots Wow my skin is so greasy that forehead dandruff hello guys and welcome to sophisticated obsession on today's show we look at skincare brand a stop in particular we will then be discussing my skincare routine coming up it is Matt here from sophisticated obsession with another video for you guys so today we are going to be looking at skincare so at the start of the video maybe it is you that is saying one or two of those things when you look in the mirror and that your skin is just not doing what you wanted to do now today we are going to be discovering the brand ESOP and exactly what ISIL can do for your skin so ISIL is an Australian brand and it boasts of using really really natural products and remedies now I've got to say that just off the back from this I have had absolutely brilliant customer service from Aesop whether it is dealing online or whether it is actually going into a store they are so so generous when it comes to their samples and they seem to really really care about your skin I've been into a couple of the stores in London and each time I've been in London I have come out 100% satisfied so customer service seems to be a real major thing for this company likewise when I was dealing on the line I had a couple of problems because some of my items had been damaged on the delivery by email literally within 24 hours they got back to me and says no that's absolutely fine we're going to send you out a brand new pack they sent me everything so they are so so generous and I've got to say I absolutely love dealing with them let's look at their philosophy first of all cleanse cleaners basically means to clean the skin and you do this at the start of your skincare routine so it might be that you then you have a shower and then you do your cleansing after or if you are wanting to maybe do it on the other side of the day so if you take a shower in the morning then in the evening before you then apply your moisturizer you then want to then cleanse the skin to make sure that it hasn't got any impurities from the down this basically means that you have got them a blank canvas for your skin to work with number two tone tone basically means to ready the skin for hydration this just makes sure that your skin takes all of the moisture that is on offer to it number three hydration hydration fairly self-explanatory and probably the most well known out of these three elements it is basically putting on a moisturizer it is giving your skin moisture giving back to it making sure that your skin feels nourished rather than leathery now for my little disclaimer this is a product review that has worked for me on Aesop and I will put a link to their website just down below but on a stop they have loads and loads of products and most of which are not beneficial to me so today we are going to be looking through my skincare routine and then you can sort of take from that what elements you think will work for you and let's discard the rest so my skin type my skin type is what they call a combination skin type where I have slightly oily skin down my like my nose on my cheeks maybe around like where my my neckline is but then I've got really really dry skin when it comes to like my forehead my scalp I find that if I then apply too much moisture to my skin that will then make my skin really really greasy and also it can affect my hair if I apply to you less then I find that I get this weird of forehead dandruff thing going on it's not pleasant now I've recently found that I've had problems with my skincare I don't know if that it's because of my change blood location maybe if it's the change of weather that can that can have like in the FAQs or it might be that I'm just not drinking enough water all of those things could have an effect so let's get into it number one cleanse for cleanse I am using the parsley seed cleanser this cleanser comes with a pump just on top so you can then have an even distribution this is brilliant this is a breve product because it takes away all of that excess grime and all of the excess oil that's on your skin but it does not let your skin feel like paper and parchment so it doesn't dry out your skin it is important that after you have used this to then use a hydrating cream or an eye hydrating oil straight after all you need to do with this is take one pump then make a nice lava and apply onto your skin which is already damp just apply it and in just circle motions then just rub it into your skin leave it for a moment and then rinse number two toner so this is the parsley seed toner now this readies your skin ready for hydration this is brilliant this works as a really nice cleanser have enough time to then do the first process this works just as well however it isn't so much about nourishing clean as the actual cleanser this I find is really really nice just before bed it's awful Ivan's your skin and it makes it feel really really fresh now as you can see I have used absolutely loads of this because I use it at the start of my day and I also use it at the end of my day how do you apply this simply put a couple of drops upon your hands and then very gently just Pat this onto your skin you don't need to rub it and then just leave it to dry this should only take a few seconds number three hydration hydration is an interesting one because you then need to judge how your skin is feeling after those first two steps if my skin is feeling quiet nourished and it's feeling fairly hydrated but I just need a little pick-me-up I have been chosen the Mandarin facial hydrating cream now this cream is really really nice it's not too thick but it smells absolutely beautiful all you need to do is just apply a small amount onto your hand rub it and then in very small circle motions then just apply it to your face this product will leave your skin feeling really nourished but not overly thick so your skin can still have that breathable the fact this product will not make your skin feel extra thick and clumpy if I'm feeling like the manager and facial hydrating cream does not quite do it I can then combine this product with the cream is the damask and rose facial treatment now this can be applied on its own or it can be applied with another product and mixed in this oil now if your skin is oily don't worry Mike's my skin as I said before is is a combination so around my nose and around my my cheeks it can be quite oily with this it is absolutely fine this finishes in more like a matte finish so it's not gonna feel really greasy by the end of it all you need to do is apply three to five drops then just rub it ever so slightly on your hands and then apply to your face if you want to then combine it with another cream you could do so when you put your cream onto your hands combine it there and finally if my skin is feeling really thirsty and it's feeling really really tired I have then got the chameleon nut facial hydrating cream this is extra thing this is very nourishing and I would probably say that this cream you should be wearing before you go to bed I find that with this cream I can apply it before I go to work because it's too thick and I feel like my skin isn't really able to breathe that is when I would use my manager encourage just like a Mandarin hydration cream all you need to do is just apply a small amount onto your hammies rub it and then apply onto your face after your tone and cleanse routine the last products that I have is not for your face but for your hands and I absolutely love it this is the resurrection aromatic happened wash as it is basically the glorified soap it is but this is absolutely brilliant it makes your your hands feel so fresh so clean I mean this will get leach the dirtiest hands-free of Grimes these products are what I use on my day to day life there are absolutely loads of products in Aesop that might be perfect for you if you do have any questions about the products that I have then spoken about today or any products that they have online just

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_woKkKIAgI,hey everyone welcome back to another episode I hope you are doing well today we're going to be talking about if this hand wash and bomb is worth your money let's get into it [Music] if this is your first time here then welcome my name is Jess from writtenby dress.com and I make videos and written blog post content mostly about sneakers and lifestyle products just like this one here so if you like watching videos on that type of content then please consider hitting that subscribe button below I would truly appreciate your support and for those who are tuning in for another episode welcome back thanks for being here so today we are going to be doing a review of the Aesop Resurrection hand wash and bomb which I have right here so let's go over a little bit of the information first and then I'll get into my honest review about this product here so I actually purchased this off a European a UK website because it was a lot cheaper and I bought this like a while ago probably a few months ago before Christmas Time Around October or November and this store was having a pretty good sale on it so I decided to purchase it I think at the time I paid about a hundred and twenty dollars Canadian with everything included so that came out to be about 60 each for each of these bottles here I was looking online here in Canada and currently it's going for 105 plus tax which is almost about 60 dollars per bottle and I think the price may have dropped recently because when I was doing my research and purchasing mine it was a lot more than that when I saw on the website maybe I looked at a different item I'm not really sure but it's now down to 105 plus tax of course here in Toronto which again is going to be about 59 to 60 dollars per bottle so it's not a cheap product by any means and I'm sure if you're watching this video you probably already know that I want to know if this is worth spending your money on so this does come bundled together as I previously mentioned and it will come in like a cardboard box bundle like this and to go over the scent the scent of this is Mandarin rind rosemary leaf and Cedar Atlas and just for me to give you a little bit of context on what it actually smells like if you like the smell of the aromatherapy line from a bath and body I believe then you're likely probably gonna like this scent here it's a very aromatherapy for it a very strong scent so if you like that kind of thing then you are going to love this product the size for this is 16.5 fluid ounces or that's 500 milliliters so the next thing that I want to do is just actually try and show you what product looks like so it is a very like jelly soap and it's clear it's liquidy and then the actual lotion or hand bomb it's like a yellowish color which I was like pretty surprised when I saw that let's go over the pros for this product my hands did seem to stay hydrated for a lot longer and I don't know if it's actually the use of the liquid soap or if it's actually the bomb I'm not sure which one it is but maybe it's a combination of both but they did seem to stay hydrated for a lot longer and soft especially throughout the dry months here in Canada so that is the number one pro for me in using this product here the other good thing is that the ascent will stay relatively long on your hands so it's something that you can actually smell after you use it even when you're doing a lot of things around the house or going out I still find that I can smell it on my hands and it smells good so if you like the scent then you will enjoy these end a little bit longer when you are using it on your hands to wash uh the other thing is when you actually go into the Aesop store I will say this is not really a pro for the actual product but I will say that the experience is a luxury experience when you go into the store you can kind of have that Vibe of like it being very simplistic very minimal there but they are a pro in whatever they're selling you so I thought that experience was pretty awesome we have one here in Toronto and I do enjoy going in there and smelling all the differences that they have because they have other products as well these are probably just like one of the more well-known things that you think of when you hear Aesop let's talk about the cons or negatives for this product and the first one being that this is made of plastic and I was so so disappointed when I opened up the box and I noticed that it wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be uh and when I opened it up there it is it's plastic I was so disappointed I thought you know I'm paying for luxury and paying for that premium and I thought that it would the product would come in a amber glass bottle but I was definitely wrong when I saw it on social media I thought it was glass but again did not make the right assumption on that but nonetheless the product is still good in my opinion so that kind of saves up for that I read on the Aesop website that you can actually purchase a glass container and come to the store to have it refilled so I think that's a step in the right direction I do know that there are other products that they sell and they do already come in glass bottles and there are particular reasons for that whether it's just to make sure that the product that they have in there is safe for use for the consumer while I was doing research for this video I will note that most of the ingredients in this product here are essential oils so I think Aesop is really known for blending these oils and smells together to make the most ideal scent that people actually really love so in saying that I will say that the actual cleaning agent in the hand wash is one that is pretty common in a lot of different things like soap body wash shampoo things like that it's a cleaning agent and I was doing my research and it said that it's a pretty common ingredient it's not really a luxury ingredient by any means so I was kind of disappointed in that because you are spending a lot of your hard-earned money on this product here and I thought they would be using a little bit more of a luxury cleaning agent just in my opinion My overall thoughts on this is will I purchase this item again and to answer that question I probably won't be purchasing this item just because it's pretty expensive for what it is I think and I'm to the challenge I think I'm able to find another soap that is going to do a good job in my hands staying hydrated so I'm up to the challenge and I will let you know if I do find something that I think is relatively equal to this I don't use it every day to be honest with you because sometimes I don't like that woodsy citrusy smell because I did mention they do say the scent does stay quite a while on your hands sometimes when it's too much for me I get a headache and this is just generally for me sometimes if I smell something for too long that just happens to me so when I'm feeling like I don't want to deal with that I just grab my bar soap from the shower and I will use that to wash my hands as opposed to using this so I think this is probably really cool to have in your guest room or the powder room where someone isn't kind of using the soap every single day as I previously mentioned and it's just a really cool experience to have when you have guests over and they are having a very luxurious bathroom experience in your home so I think that's a good alternative which I just kind of thought of right and now there is actually another scent and it's called the Aesop reverence aromatic and this one has a more of a woodsy and earthy scent if you're kind of into that so that's another option for you if you're not super crazy about smelling this scent there's one other thing I wanted to know if you look at the bottle for the bomb you can actually read here which I just kind of like discovered while doing this prep for the video was also ideal for massaging dry tired feet every night before bed which I think would be really awesome just because of the aromatherapy Vibes and I'm getting from this scent so I'm definitely gonna try that on my feet because you know a lot of people have dry cracked feet so I will definitely be trying this and seeing if it helps me maybe it'll help me go to sleep a little bit faster who knows but I will be trying that for sure but all in all again I probably won't be buying this I know a lot of people just buy it once and then fill it with their own soap so that's probably what I'm going to be doing that's going to do for today's review of the ASAP Resurrection hand wash and hand bomb I hope you enjoyed it let me know if you have this set in your home and what your honest thoughts are I'm very curious to hear what other opinions are and I will catch you in the next video peace bye hey everyone thanks for checking out today's video please consider subscribing to see more content

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPm0OwsmkYE,hand balm hand cream etc so of course all the oils that i talked about earlier can be used on your hands in fact some will remain on your hands you rub it in there that's great but on the go or when you don't want to be using an oil because i know that can be more difficult like during the day you don't want oily hands um whatever it may be it's nice to have a hand cream something specifically formulated for your hands so i'm talking about the brand aesop and i have two from here again that i will show you so this is the reverence aromatique hand bomb it has vertebrae root pettigreen bergamot rind and this is a really rich hand bomb so this one the other one is more of like a summer spring scent this is more of like what i would call a fall winter scent so as you can see here looks like your tape pretty typical like hand lotion what really sets these apart again similar to some of the other ones i've talked about is the scent i absolutely love how rich and aromatic aesop's products are this one's really woody um really really stays on the skin which is nice always get compliments whenever i have these on it's almost like perfumey if you're not into that this probably won't be up your alley because it definitely is um but the best thing about these hand bombs is that while they're so rich and so so so immediately moisturizing they really do dry like almost instantly and beautifully they still leave you with that like amazing hydrated feeling but no stickiness no residue if you need to like touch your phone touch papers your computer whatever these both come to 2550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gai1V4urGVM,hey guys what's up um i'm sure if you click to watch this video it means you just you're probably thinking of buying some insult products and you just want to know have an idea of how much what the product is like because it is a very popular brand and quite expensive as well so you probably do want to know quite a few things about it i know before i purchased some aesop stuff i was like you know what before i put some coins down i'm gonna know if this actually does what it says it does um if it does they view that i mean you already know i feel like a lot of people know about this brand it is a very like it's quite luxurious um and so i wanted actually for to have it as like a nice aesthetics for my wardrobe and for my sorry for my bathroom so i wanted my bathroom to just kind of look pretty and quite welcoming and a bit luxe and i felt like the cheapest way and the best way to add some locks to your home is actually asap i love the brand the packaging is beautiful if you haven't seen it it comes in like a black packaging with like quite minimal but it just does something to your interior that just looks a fab so this hand wash is the best seller like i said um it is 27 pounds um for hand wash and it is 500 ml it contains man mandarin rosemary leaf and siddha cedar atlas honestly off of these things english isn't my first language so um okay what do i think about this i think this product is actually great um i mean it does what it's supposed to do it does wash your hands it cleans your hands it has the most fantastic smell and it's i actually thought the smell would be quite like intense and it's gonna infuse your whole bathroom with this wonderful spa like feel but actually the smell isn't as intense like you would smell it um while you're washing your hands you have a nice experience with it a good enough experience today but i don't think it's i thought it would be a lot more intense which i guess it's a good thing that it's not too intense i don't know um but it definitely does what it's supposed to do in terms of a hand wash it also looks fantastic in my bathroom it just looks nice it just looks nice you best believe i don't use this every day because i mean i wash my hands every time i smell them but i don't use this one every single day because it's 27 pounds it's more also for decoration is it worth 27 pounds i would say i don't know it just depends on the money you have in your bank account okay for regular 27 pounds isn't that expensive if you actually think about it for some people but in general in terms of just normal people you have to think about two questions you have to ask yourself is can you buy it again if you can't buy it again don't buy it the first time and that should apply to basically your whole life anything you're trying to buy beautiful product anything it's can i buy this twice if you can't buy it twice probably don't buy it number one and then number two is what is what aesthetic am i trying to create my bathroom if your bathroom is just a normal basic bathroom and you don't really care then i then there's no point just buy another hand wash if you're trying to create some element of luxury in your home but you're not trying to like buy designer stuff or like buy super expensive home stuff or like super expensive and just a little locks in your life i think this brand could really do that for you so it's a fantastic product can't lie all right i'm gonna go to the po post poo drop this i feel like everyone needs this 100 ml i believe um yes 100 mil and it's 20 pounds it's actually really affordable and this will last you for so long i've had this for like three months now and this is how much i mean you can also if you go bathroom all the time then probably probably you use a bit more or if you have guests that are just constantly your house then maybe it will go down a bit more but i don't my guess does really come and pull in my house so this would last you a long time if you've done a pool and that embarrassing feeling of someone else is coming into the bathroom and they're like girls then what did you eat someone dying you know it's like just so embarrassing or if you go to your boyfriend's house or if you go to a guest if you go to someone's house and you want to do a you should be able to right and i feel like this product is needed it's like when you pull just put a few drops in the bowl in the bathroom and then it smells great your bathroom didn't stink it just smells nice so it gives takes with that embarrassing feeling the only thing is if your poo smells like a dead person has just been dropped in the in the toilet it will eliminate some of it but not all of it i don't think i think only jesus can help you with that one um and i don't think it it does for like it does for like intense pool smell like if your poo is just all wild it would help but it doesn't eliminate everything you will still have to like turn on your bench open your window a little bit but it's great it helps it helps a bit it helps for like intense pool but it's fantastic and it looks great in my bathroom look at it it's so cute it's like when people just see it like just a cute experience also another thing that i use this for is um when i just like clean my bathroom i just like made my bathroom like really clean or i have guests coming over and i just want like a nice experience when they come into the bathroom when not necessarily because they want to pool or someone has just done a pool just to have a nice smell in my bathroom i run the tap in my sink and then um just like put some water in there and then put some few drops put a few drops in the sink with some water and also put some in the toilet and what that does and i just close it and what that does is it just infuses the whole bathroom with this beautiful citrusy smell and it's just like oh lovely so it's a nice experience for people that come into your bathroom as well so i really love this product i think it's great for everyone to have it's 20 pounds it's very affordable and will last you ages okay next product is let me go to the room spray just on that along with the whole fragrance vibes they don't sell the size on its own this is a 50 ml and they only saw the 100 ml on its own which is 40 pounds 100 mil the 50 ml comes in a gift set so the gifts that i actually got as a gift um which i will come back to i got it as a gift which comes with another hand wash i'm so glad i didn't have to buy another one yet another hand wash um this and the poop spray so it comes together in three the hundred meal is 40 pounds 40 pounds for a room spray would say i don't know if i would spend 40 pounds for room spray and that's me just being honest even if it's asap that's a lot of money for room spray having said that though having experienced this as a 50 million was a gift i love it i love this product compared to the other room sprays i've used like which is quite cheap cheaper room sprays what cheaper room sprays does is it smells you infuses your room which it doesn't actually give it that spa feeling that i wanted um number one and number two the smell goes really quickly like honestly spray it in your room to one minute five minutes it's gone it's gone it just gives you that intense boost and it's gone this actually lingers around longer than cheaper brands so i feel like in that sense it's worth it it lasts quite a bit in your room in your space it gives you that like i wanted a spa you know like to go into like uh just like come into a spa like just a nice calm zen spa like smell and i got that from this it stays in your room for a while it's nice if you've got guests or coming and you just like spray your house and it's just like ugh people just come in and just like it's that small it's the most fantastic um but is it worth it in terms of the smell and what it does the performance yes if you have 40 pounds um to splurge on a room spray i say go for asap because it smells divine i want to try the other smells but this smells sticky it smells so good okay going to the two mouth products let me start with the mouthwash maybe the mouthwash is huge it's 500ml is it amazing that huge 500ml it's big it's big and it's 17 pounds it's not that expensive it's not that expensive um 17 pounds for 500 mil actually it is compared to other companies a bunch of other brands it is but the thing about this is i trust asap with my mouth you know what i mean i just some brands i just trust that they put some good quality products in there and if i'm gonna be cleaning my mouth i just want some nice good products going into my mouth nothing burning my mouth nothing too intense something that's just nice and easy to just swirl around the mouth and it's not gonna cause me pain because you see you know there's a mouthwash that you put in you're like jesus it just burns everything it's like yo it's not that deep i know i paid five dollars but jesus you must hurt me like this um it's always quite gentle in the mouth it there's a spearmint um spearmint flavor to it but it doesn't burn it's just nice and easy um i usually use it at night so when i wake up does my mouth smell like does it make any difference in my mouth without i don't i don't know if it makes any difference in my mouth than if i didn't use it but it just feels nice to have i bought it mainly for this but it's can't lie but it's a good mouthwash again if you can buy it twice do it if you can't buy it twice probably not finally the toothpaste oh and been ranting for so long okay your toothpaste is 10 pounds pretty affordable 10 pounds for 60 mil of a toothpastes are like i don't know i think this the bigger than 60 ml probably 100 ml from normal toothpaste and they're like four pounds three pounds two pounds whatever you're into should you be paying 10 pounds for toothpaste um it is good again it is good products in there it doesn't burn your mouth it's actually quite different from normal toothpaste you've used this one doesn't it's not too minty it's just like herbal i think that's why it's like a herbal vibe in your mouth it's nice you get used to it at first you're like what's going on here especially if you use normal toothpaste for like ever you're like this is different but this one i'm not sure about this one i feel like when i use it i feel i notice i feel like it needs a brush again i i brush like three to four times a day anyway but this i feel like i noticed like i need to brush my mouth again um which i don't know if i'm gonna be buying this again i think this is the only product that i may not buy again overall it's just i love asap i can't really save anything bad i'm gonna have more insub stuff in my mouth in my bathroom in my life it's just seeing nice luxury things incorporated in your life and i feel like everyone is seeing fuse a little luxury in their life something that it doesn't even have to be expensive like the mouthwash is 17 pounds but it's kind of luxurious it looks nice it's good for you just a little lush in your life just just actually just feels nice it feels nice anyways guys i will see you in my next video have a fantastic day as you go forward bye guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aycxS2yKviQ,so the rick owens aesop collaboration is out now generally i'm not the biggest fan of designer collabs there's just so many of them as they've realized it's quite profitable usually the hype surrounding these causes them to sell out instantly but i also think it's an interesting lesson for the brand that if you make a decently priced well-designed object a lot of people will come by it and i think that's usually the appeal that you get the design sensibility of rick owens but at a price point closer to aesop similar with like rick owens champion it's expensive for champion but cheap for rick so it draws a wider audience um as far as this goes it's definitely more of an asop product it feels like than a rick owens product um but obviously the shape of the candle this vessel is very reminiscent of the shape of some of the rick owens vases and furniture which are several thousands of dollars um as is true with these collabs it's already sold out it was online yesterday i almost bought it online but there was 30 shipping um and i live in new york so today i went to the ric boutique they already sold out of the size medium they had a large and expected to be sold out by the end of the day but fear not um supposedly larger aesop stores are also going to carry this so i think distribution won't be quite so limited and exclusive if you'd like to get that i think maybe they'll pop up on aesop's site eventually but i'm not sure pricing is not terrible a regular aesop candle i think is in the hundred dollar range their medium was 100 i think the small voted is 45 and the large 3-wick is 225. um they looked a lot smaller in person so i'm glad i went to see it in person because i was going to buy the medium but it looks kind of dinky and i felt like if you're going to get it you know go for the big one it's more significant of a kind of vessel that you can use afterwards i'll also say along those lines that it looks better online in person it looks a little bit cheaper the material and construction but i suppose that's to be expected it's not going to look like the several thousand dollar steel wrought iron or ceramic um rick owens furniture piece it must be i realized uh just a few minutes ago actually that the the aesop candle looks exactly like this material so it's probably the aesop candle material definitely produced by aesop's facilities not rick owens uh furniture facilities but that should be obvious but it is nice i like the vessel it's really nice and so the smell it's mostly patchouli very patchouli forward the other things that are included is the travel kit with some of rick owens favorite asop products but they're just normal asop products with some rick owens branding and uh an oil of the same fragrance that accompanies um beads that you can either wear on your wrist and scent with the oil or you can hang it as like a diffuser which is something aesop does when you go into their store to try a fragrance they spray it onto a little ceramic disc for you to smell um i like that idea but i didn't like the idea of having to buy the travel kit just to get the oil because to be honest aesop's uh products as far as being good for your skin um they aren't uh any dermatologist will tell you all these essential oils are very irritating everything i've put on my face from them has broken me out but they do scent and they use style really well so i do use their hand wash i use their hand lotion sometimes but i wouldn't use anything from them that you put or leave on your face if you value your skin um but the scent of the candle reminds me of the coriander line which is what uh rick chose for the body wash that comes in the kit it's peppery um it's a lot a lot a lot of patchouli and not much else it's not smokey it's not incense-y it's not as dark or goth as you might expect from rick owens very much has kind of a signature a soppy smell um but if you're a patchouli fan you might love this i've got all three wicks burning here because i'm trying to burn burn it flat to the top on the first burn and my place is really smelling like patchouli right now it's really strong anyway it comes in this nice box which again i feel like i could reuse this put something in it um no i've got enough rick i've loved work a long time i used to actually wear quite a bit of rick owens um but i'm just not that hardcore anymore i like more simple minimalist designers jill sanders one of my favorites right now um but his tailoring i still like the tailoring um little info card it comes with another bag again it's if you bought it aesop these are the kind of bags they give you and it came with this free tote again it's all right it's again that kind of um you know very like raw feeling canvas that aesop uses um again kind of a shout out to the way rick will give you a free like cotton tote bag with purchases which funny enough has become like sort of status items that people even resell which is ridiculous um i've got a bunch of them laying around um but it's kind of lame if you if you buy the bag that comes free with other stuff anyway uh that's my short review lots of patchouli if you like patchouli if you like the look of the vessel maybe worth seeking out um but like all these designer collabs if you don't get it you're not missing out on that much you can always buy the aesop candle you could buy a sierra true dawn candle that has patchouli elements but it's nice nothing to lose your mind over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ920-ROXfQ,this one right here so it's a mist it's your hydrate or mist uh literally refreshments throughout the day uh because of its smell i love to apply it uh not on the schedule before moisturizer before serum after moisturizer throughout the day like literally any time that i am missing this vibe it's um it's a medium moisture facial hydrator uh spray which sprays amazingly well like this i don't know if you can even see it like wonderful now it's flying in the air so like very very tiny particles uh what else we have here we have a rose petal which makes this whole experience so much better that is bergamot peel and chamomile bud now from other other ingredients we have we have geranium we have citral and limonene that's the one the ones that i know and to choose something um beautiful product to refresh your face throughout the day to you know have it on top of your makeup to like set it all a little and infuse your face with moisture and use life in it uh really really amazing on its own as a moisturizer but um you know my skin is super dry so i have to like have some cream on top of it and then i'm using it this one throughout the day and as i miss you really need just two or three pumps well really two is enough and uh guys the smell is fantastic it's rose petals it's a refreshment mist throughout the day especially if you are somewhere outside and you don't want to touch your face if you're in the office if you're in school if you are at work uh after the gym if you're on the go if you're on the train plane wherever you are to take it with you to refresh your feet throughout the day is amazing and sometimes i use it on top of the makeup uh to make it look more natural to the skin uh because it's like i don't know the hydration and it really helps it's not like a makeup set a setup or like this makeup settlement what what's that what's that um product called that you put on top of the makeup specifically this one i'm sure not i'm probably the only one who use it this way but it really works like uh when you set your foundation powder and all the stuff and then just spray it a little and your makeup looks really um more alive and like your skin so uh it is for all skin types so this line is for combination skin uh which really helps to even the skin tone even the ph so this one is for all the skin types so you guys if you have oily if you have dry if you have combination skin um really is an amazing product personally and my personal use for the soul thank you for the diamonds uh because i love the rose petals it reminds me of the whole childhood and brings me such joy when i'm using it uh the hydration is here too is present like i still feel it on my face so it stays in my face like a tiny

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFiDc5-Narg,hey everyone talking about miracetti by Aesop the notes in this are black pepper green mate chili leaf labdenum and Bratz tyrax myrrh Cedar and red seaweed so when we were kids parents used to take me and my brother to this place called the little farm where they had like you know pigs chickens horses rabbits stuff like that and the opening of this smells exactly like my memory of that like not just the animals but right down to like the chicken coop bedding the lettuce that they gave us to feed the rabbits um definitely very nostalgic for me to smell but I don't want to smell like a farm but I know a lot of you actually do because everybody some people really like earthy fragrances even this type so I think this is a high quality take on smelling like a farm um 195 for a 50 milliliter unisex lining slightly masculine with low to moderate longevity and projection and I'm sure not everyone gets that out of it and again I do like they actually like the scent like I guess the Nostalgia Factor but just to kind of dirty and wild Outdoors farm for me to want to wear but if it smells different to you let me know and I'll link in the description where you can check it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmkv4oqSGl8,hi guys welcome to my youtube channel welcome to skin care design today i want to introduce esop tussy to the fragrance um so this is an eau de parfum comes in 50 ml it is a lovely glass bottle a brown painted glass bowl actually so you have to be careful when you travel with this bottle for example because the paint can peel off um so just be a little bit careful when you travel with it for example and don't put it next to other glass products but other than that if you just keep it at home for example nothing should happen just to give you a little reminder about because not many people know about this um so this fragrance at first when i smelled it it um for me it was more like a very traditional fresh scent but it transforms into something more special after a couple of minutes on your skin so you can really smell the basil for example after a few minutes but and the freshness the super super fresh scent will disappear um after a couple of minutes then it's just like something more herby and fresh a mix of herbs and freshness i would say perfect for the summer and if you look if you're looking more for like a traditional fresh fragrance in the eats of fragrance range for example i would highly recommend the toasted one absolutely love this and this is my go-to for the month for summer for example i really adore this one and this lasts such a long time as well in my opinion the rozu one doesn't last this long it's the tuscan one the task one um lasts on your on your skin scent for for like six hours maybe um definitely a long time and i would highly recommend this one if you're looking for a classic fragrance i want to give this product to a friend for example a lovely product i recommend this one thank you so much for watching if you've got any questions please let me know in the comments below and please don't forget to subscribe and to give me thumbs up thank you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN8WOEXAwsk,the aesop parsley seed cleansing mask i have it here to show you it's a cute little tube aluminum tube um hello welcome so this is the parsley seed cleansing mask as i said sorry about that we're having some technical so this is a clay mask as i said i will show you the consistency of it i'm not going to apply it since i already applied the other one but it's a clay mask it's kind of like a light tan color um it's a super soft clay mask um i feel like a lot of clay masks at least that i've tried out in the past are super drying whereas this one is not you can even see as i'm applying it's a little more wet than what a lot of clay masks typically look like it has it's definitely more fragrant than this one it has a floral scent to it soft floral scent though and um parsley seed is the main ingredient in this which is really great for um breakouts or acne prone skin so if that's your struggle this is the one you're going to want to add to bag so clay is great because it does kind of dry up breakouts but this one's amazing because it doesn't dry out your skin a lot you know sometimes you want to dry out pimples but you're kind of sacrificing your entire face if you just have a breakout in like one area because it just really dries out your skin so i love that this doesn't do that and i kind of have a thick layer on my hand but hopefully you'll be able to see that as it dries it still stays like soft it doesn't pull and tug i know a lot of clay masks they literally start to like crack off and like sting and pull this does not do that which i love but it's still a clay mask which is so nice i've honestly never come across a mask of clay that is so gentle um until i found this and actually the next one i'm going to talk about is also a clay mask that is also very nice and gentle but this is great because it's a cleansing mask as i said it really cleans out your pores which is amazing if you're acne prone um this is great if you're oily um but again for all skin types really i have sensitive skin and have no issues with this where i have had issues with some clay masks in the past really synthesizing my skin not an issue with this one whatsoever so um this is perfect to leave the skin feeling really clean rejuvenated especially when you have a breakout and you just like really want to feel like you've cleaned it and it's ready to heal this is perfect for that um yeah so if you're into clay masks this is a great more gentle option if you have sensitive skin highly recommend it has evening primrose and rose hip seed oil which is super hydrating and plumping to the skin so again it's not going to dry you out too much it's still going to leave you with that clean feeling that you want especially when you're breaking out but really moisturizing plump and just feeling hydrated and good which is important even if you do have oily skin you need to hydrate yes the more you know about parsley very fun so again great option for those of us who are acne prone or have breakouts struggle with acne in general this one's really great for anyone who really loves a glowy dewy um skin look plumping of the skin rejuvenating and um actually something i forgot to say about cora that i just want to say because it's so cool is that they um like put what is it called let me see if i have here they energize their products with rose quartz which is a crystal that is believed to be really um rejuvenating and just full of love and good vibes and so they literally energize their products with that which i think is so cool whether you believe in crystals or not it's just like good vibes and believing in it is half the battle to it actually doing what it should you know what i mean like part of it is the placebo effect but i love that it's like good vibrations and they care so we love that i just wanted to throw that in but um so yeah that is this one as you can see as it's drying more it i know it's hard to tell on camera it's pretty much almost dry but again it's still not pulling at all it feels so nice i don't know i think it's really nice that this exists that you can use a clay mask and as you see it can see it kind of dries like tan it's kind of hard to see on my hand now because it's kind of matching my skin tone but yeah really great option for a clay mask i will never go back to those like clay masks that just crack off your face it's just not a good look um okay and now let's move on to our last mask which is the grown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRwhteRhe0,have you ever wondered are asap products worth it well i've tested a few and here are the three asap products that i think are worth buying let's begin with the parsley seed facial cleansing oil i've been using this for years and i love it because it cleanses without dehydrating and leaves your face feeling perfectly refreshed the ingredients feature a medley of oils from nuts and seeds including macadamia nut sunflower seed and parsley seed to use i apply three to four drops directly to my face massage massage massage and then i rinse it all off with warm water next up is the lucent facial concentrate this one is my holy grail product i use it as a serum so i apply it after cleansing and toning and before moisturizer i love it because it smooths out my pores and adds a natural dewy glow to my skin it smells of light roses and is infused with vitamin c and b3 for a full breakdown of its ingredients i found this wonderful website that breaks down each ingredient into easy non-scientific terms which i will leave in the description box for those who are interested and finally we have the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i first bought this because an aesop store associate told me that the loosened facial concentrate is best paired with the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i love it because it is super hydrating and protects against environmental aggressors the only con is that it is rather fragrant so i would recommend this for those who have sensitivity to fragrance it is full of hydrating ingredients such as aloe vera leaf gel sweet almond oil and shea butter although a full breakdown of its ingredients will also be in the description box below and that wraps up my list at least so far of asap products worth buying i have been using these products for at least two years now and they're still my favorites so i think that's saying a lot though if you have any questions feel free to pop them in the comments below [Music]

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj-8-dyp1Y8,so the villain talk to you now about one of my favorite one of my favorite having Jason doesn't use this I mean he was introducing it to them you'll find on pop beauty it's actually a large pump bottle which is great to keep by the bed besides I have a homozygote you actually can see what we used as everything is I love you so it's a great brand really fantastic products really easy to use no hype no synthetic ingredients and this product I love it's like an interesting pigment Hartley because of the smell you can smell in there chamomile man to an oil some the word so it's really fragile that's beautiful and I love it because I use it for it's bad because it helps you dish in my nails you can use it on the body if you want to as well but if you do use it during day like the tube what if you carry it around in your bag it's not over greasing so is that so important especially they're not using phones and you wanted to sinking quite quickly it's interesting what you're saying about using hand cream before you go to bed I never ever go to bed with me no lip balm and how angry were the last two things I knew before entities well so as I said when you look for this on the website even being a large pump bottle which is really great value but it's certainly one my photos if you're not familiar with you stop and take a look sense of Resurrection hammer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r_wJ0amt3xs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.lover.fm%2F&feature=emb_imp_woyt,hey everyone talking about tacit by Aesop the notes in this are Yuzu Citrus basil vetiver and clove very high quality very like natural smelling citrus green with woodsy and rootsy vetiver undertones that kind of come out more and more as it dries down I think the ASAP is really underrated in the sense that when people talk about them they talk about them very highly but they aren't referenced as much as I would think that they should be for the quality and everything and everything I've tried from them has always felt like really good combination of high quality and like attractive smelling for the most part and this is definitely no exception I also feel like I like that they don't just put out a million things they kind of they come correct when they do put stuff out so yeah this feels tropical but not in a floral or like obvious way more like the feeling of like a laid back upscale Island Resort in the South Pacific with the like vetiver surrounding to me this just feels like contentment relaxation but also kind of invigorating at the same time so yeah if you like the idea of a citrus vetiver sense with some kind of Warm Spice and some green absolutely recommend this I really really like this 140 for a 50 milliliter unisex leaning masculine with low to moderate longevity and projection I would say so if that's a deal breaker for you maybe don't get it but I personally love it and it's not like a skin scent or something either at least not for me and uh yeah I'll link in the description where you can check it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgepkC-OZjQ,so as you can see the bottle is bigger in comparison this is 100 milliliters this is probably 200. yep this is 200 milliliters and this is a toner uh now as i have just cleaned my face with the cleanser i'm going to just apply it on my hands and uh tap it into my skin toner making sure that uh your skin well if you are you okay the toner was used as a cleanser right before we got all the cleansers and um in the skincare routine so you can still use it this way which sometimes i do if i don't have if i'm skipping the cleanser because i'm not wearing makeup or i feel like my face just need a little you know be prepared for observing all the elements that are going to be next or just like tone it up a little so i'm just using toner and i'm using it on a cotton pad and i'm stripping away the dirt and don't forget behind your ears that's a little secret for me uh because if you're forgetting this part trust me there's a lot of dirt right there well not a lot a lot but you know i mean so in two minds facial toner is also for combination skin uh it's evening the skin tone it's evening the ph of your skin tone as well and making sure that the parts of your face that are over producing oil are not over producing it and the parts that are super dry are balanced too uh it has nice cinnamon which is a wonderful ingredient in general i need to get my nice cinnamite updated i get it from reevox just like pure nice and early like ten percent semi serum uh it is so good on fighting hyperpigmentation like i know i have this guy right here right now but i also have a guy here like maybe two weeks ago and there is almost no sign of the pimple left because the pigmentation like the redness you know that how it's left with hot with with my cinnamide is going away it's one thing one perk of it the second is blemish like all the blemishes in general underlying under the skin little bumps that are not pimples and you cannot deal with them the cinemite helps it so much in general a great hydrator so so many things in one this in this ingredient so this one also has witch hazel as a toner because it's into mine's facial cleanser nice cinnamon as i said and chamomile butt to calm your skin so literally what i'm gonna do it has a little um cap on it so we have the doughs the right domes and we are not overspilling it smells herby as well chamomile chamomile and i want to say like parsley but me parsley is not part of the sauna i don't think so maybe that's witch hazel and chamomile i'm going to add just a little more because i want to like get set for the day and uh i love like a little tingle that this gives me like really little for like a couple seconds but i love the alternate um active ingredients in it and we also have so camille said we have lavender here as well we have rosemary salicylic acid and um sage oil citric acid um yeah this one is really good i love it so much guys and i have been using it and i am still like on the top right here it's lasting a long time what i've just realized it's been like three months it's lasting a long time love it so uh it's 45 dollars it's 200 milliliter bottle so it's a big bottle and if you are um trying to get rid of acne and acne scars nice cinnamide house with that too because it's hyperpigmentation and uh in two minds facial toner especially if you have combination skin are perfect together this is a cleanser this is a toner so and esab is a very well known brand guys so you're welcome you're welcome uh now we are going to the next step which in this case would be um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEZ0VHaVdAU,hello welcome to my youtube channel welcome to skincare design today i want to introduce the lucent facial concentrate from esop um so this is coming from something called which is plus range okay there's a little plus on here and this means there are a lot of vitamins um in this product which is obviously really good um for your skin so it always have i would always recommend antioxidants and vitamins in your skin care routine and what i like about this product so at first this comes in a 60 ml bottle which is um not as big being totally honest but this lasts quite a long time as you don't need a lot of this product okay so the price is around 100 pounds which is obviously also a high price point i've noticed the products from the plus range a little bit more pricey because of all the like premium ingredients there's rose petal in it there's near cinnamite in it vitamin c it's yeah it's a lovely product um so i personally have got a more combination skin i use this just after um cleansing toning and after toning and before the moisturizer so i layer this product after my toner i add a few drops onto my face and then i apply my moisturizer or my lotion okay so this is a lovely product if you want to layer it if you just want to make sure your skin has got some extra vitamins and i will show you what the consistency is like so it comes in the pipette which is quite nice so you don't use too much of the product you can see here it is almost it looks almost watery okay so you don't need a lot just a few drops and yeah feels almost watery a little bit thicker than a toner but it's very much watery on the skin um and not as thick as a traditional serum i would say so it's very lightweight absorbs quickly and yeah and you treat your skin you really spoil your skin i would say and give your skin more hydration vitamins and some amazing extra amount of ingredients you know so i would highly recommend this product i know the price point is high but in my opinion it's worth it um if you just want to make sure to add some vitamins like really high quality products um to your skin care routine i can highly recommend this product yeah if you've got any questions please let me know in the comment box below and i would appreciate if you give me thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel thank you so much for watching and have a lovely day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzmbOspvU8,to another essential that i feel like maybe you wouldn't think of which is a hand cream or a cream in general so this is actually hand bomb from aesop i love this brand they're sustainable they're cruelty free which is great and so a hand bomb i think is a great choice to have on you because it's going to be one of the thicker options as you can see here as it comes out of the tube it's definitely a rich cream but and so a bomb is good because it's going to really address whatever dryness you are are wanting to address like immediately if you have like cracked skin somewhere dry skin somewhere a bomb is really going to penetrate into that immediately and solve your issue because when you're on the go you don't have time to be dealing with like reapplication waiting for a lotion to sink in you really just want it to do what it has to do whatever that may be whether it's a cracked heel or a dry patch on your elbow this is just a great option because it's really rich and thick and it's really going to get the job done but what i love about this one in particular is that it's soaks in so nicely it doesn't leave you sticky it's just it goes in it stays in and you can probably even tell like how hydrated and nice my skin looks now so the scent is verveterroot pedigrain and bergamot rind so this is a very woody scent so i particularly love this in like fall winter months but i still like an earthy scent all year round but it's definitely a more woody type of scent so it adds a little fragrance um to you if you don't mind that um but i love this and another little hack that maybe i feel like people might not think of so i always have like flyways going on in my hair especially in the summer when it's humid and a hand cream is so nice to have on hand because you can just take whatever residue remains on your hands and kind of like i always just like will run it through the bottom of my hair if i have any flyaways on the top and it won't make your hair look greasy if it's just the tiny bit that's left on your hands it kind of just like smooths everything down and i always do this whenever i need a little like pat down on the flyaways and whatever this is a super easy way to do that without having to have both a cream and like a hair product on you it makes it kind of like a two in one so this is amazing also in the summer for i mentioned cracked heels we're wearing sandals and sometimes your heels get dry or cracked and you want to just slather something on so that you're not looking like that perfect for that um love it for fingertips when they crack yeah that's a great point this also even says on it um specifically that it's great for concentrating on the cuticles so it's amazing for that too um i have dealt with dry cuticles dry hands so i just love to have a hand cream all the time but like i said you can use it for any part of your body that gets dry throughout the day whack this on gives you a little bit of nice fragrance addresses the dryness issue that you're dealing with and a life hack that i truly swear by is the one where you just add a little bit into your hair to smooth everything out if you're someone like me who deals with humidity blowing up your hair then you'll know what i mean and i highly suggest you do this instead of having to carry around a separate hair product so hand cream super great and aesop actually has quite a few different scents so definitely look into them as a brand and see what scent sounds great to you all right so just a couple more to go we will talk now about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJUjmhWq-M4,[Music] yo what's up guys it's karsten craning back at it again with another youtube video today i wanted to show you guys some kind of insane stuff i got i got the rick owens esop collab which is currently going for hundred dollars and for both of the items i got they're both going for 800 for shampoo and conditioner pretty much which is kind of crazy so i wanted to show that to you guys i also just got back from mexico last night i spent a little bit too much time in the sun so if i look a little sunburnt so if i look a little burnt that is why so first i wanted to show you guys the rick owens um unboxing of the travel kit so obviously right now this kit is going for 500 resale it is currently sold out on all platforms please help me find my daughter and i wanted to get this for you guys to ask the question is five hundred dollars for shampoo worth it now one thing i want to add is is that if you are thinking that i legitimately spent five hundred dollars for this i did not um i was able to get this retail i snagged it i had no idea it was going to go for upwards of five hundred dollars for the shampoo kit i think i got it for like 180 off of the esop website um with the travel kit i was also able to get one of the candles so i just wanted to show you guys a little unboxing of it first so when you get your rick owens esop collab travel kit the first thing you notice you get is this tote now this tote i'm gonna be frank with you guys it's okay it's a fine tote but i hate it i hate this taupe i hate it with all my living heart but it's fine it's just a regular tote bag that says esop rick owens it's cotton it's whatever it's fine then once you get that you get your actual travel kit this has the cotton or i don't know this weird wrap that has a rick owens esop tag it's just says rick owens and esop on it with the regular double bar tag pull that off and you get your actual travel kit of course it's made out of cardboard nothing special just a bunch of words telling you what's in every single thing if you wanted to you have all the ingredients you could replicate it at home if you wanted to i don't know that might be kind of dangerous though it might be like making meth or something i don't really know it could lead to a house explosion or fire or something i'm i'm not sure now once you open your box you get all of your rick owens items here the first item you get is the coronade seed body cleanser which is pretty much just a body wash it smells pretty nice second item you get is this resolute moisturizer third item you will get is the stoic scent itself it says a toilet i'm going to call it a scent because i don't really know how to say toilet i'm not french you guys got to stop telling me i need to pronounce things in a certain way it's annoying and i've had enough of it all right here we got the classic shampoo and then finally you get the classic conditioner the bracelet is actually pretty nice um it's just a standard ceramic bracelet i believe with a string and then it has one of the little beads says esop x rick owens that's pretty nice you can tie it and it'll fit pretty much anybody no complaints with it it's it's nice it's simple but it's nice now that you guys kind of know what is all in this kit i guess my review of it as well as getting into more things first of all something i want to note is is that when you get this four out of the five actual care items are not rick owens exclusives the cleanser the body balm the conditioner and the shampoo are all things you can just buy off the esop website i'm pretty sure and the only thing that's actually special is it's going to be this cloth the beaded bracelet and the stoic scent the thing i want to say is even though that the majority of the items you are getting are not rick owens exclusive items that are special per se i wouldn't necessarily say that this box is overpriced if you're not familiar with esop um a lot of their items regularly are pretty expensive so you're not just paying 200 for no reason it's not like a rick owens kind of i'm slapping my label on this because it's ex and now i'm gonna charge 200 for this travel kit um actually two of the items in here um the body bomb and the body cleanser are already 40 bucks a bottle and then the conditioner and the shampoo are both like 20 bucks a bottle adding all of this stuff up just alone uh the esop items that you can get everywhere else the value of this is probably about a hundred dollars put the other eighty dollars to the the rick owns exclusive items and it it probably is worth around 180 to 200 and that seems to be a fair price from my standpoint i definitely wouldn't pay five hundred dollars for this apparently the items that are just from esop rick owens selected and they're just his favorite things to use from esop i don't know whatever but then um the things that i think make it special and might actually make this worth the purchase if you're a rick owens fan is the stoic scent that comes in it the stoic scent is um made exclusively for rick owens i believe he released it in for um with the scent you also get the beads apparently you're not actually supposed to put it on your skin you're supposed to put on the beads and then kind of wear the beads as the thing that gives off the scent i'm not 100 sure why you're supposed to do that i don't know if it's just kind of a gimmick but one thing i do know is is that oftentimes scents change when you put them when they interact with your skin your skin has oils um your skin has oils to it that interact with scents so that's oftentimes why you need to wear a scent a little while before you buy it so i think maybe the reason you have beads is because maybe the scent isn't supposed to be mixed with your skin and maybe it doesn't smell as good so you're just supposed to kind of put on the beads and wear it around the other thing you get besides the stoic scent and the stoic beaded bracelet is this this rick owens x a sop piece of circular tubing cloth which i don't understand everything in the else in this little travel kit is pretty cool and i like i guess it's nice this is the one thing i do not understand what it even is besides covering the travel kit it's not clear what this is supposed to be besides the tubular piece of cloth um on the website they said you could wear it as a hat i tried to do that and i did not i was not excited about the results i wasn't feeling it as a hat um still being confused of what it is i tried wearing it as a mask definitely wasn't working as a mask i mean it worked a little bit better but i still don't think this probably would have met the cdc standards maybe it's kind of like a neck gaitor i guess i'm not really sure but i have no idea what this is meant to be used for besides being a piece of cloth with the rick owens tag on it so this is kind of strange i'm not sure why they included it moving past the actual kit i also have the unboxing of the candle all right next we got the candle here when you get your rick candle i ordered this from the rick owens store instead of the esop website and let me tell you the rick owen store they give you the nice rick totes this is way better than the other tote i i love this tote i would order from the rick's store every day just for this tote unfortunately when you open your tote you find one of these crappy totes again these are going for sixty dollars the trash throw it in the garbage you don't want it or sell it on grilled for sixty dollars i don't care finally you got the candle itself candle as you can see is in this beautiful packaging it's really nice just got this black gray white color palette with two shades of gray it says esop x rig owens at the bottom here it has a bunch of warnings on it i'm not really sure what the hell any of these mean i'm pretty sure one is telling you not to put lady in a squirrel together with a candle or else you're gonna start a fire caution i don't know once you open it up you get a beautiful little handwritten note that says esop rick owens and you think it'll be a nice little message about the candle nope it's directions on how to use the candle rick owens doesn't think you can use a [ __ ] candle rick owens doesn't think you can use a candle it's stupid i know how to use a candle you just light it it's not that hard then you get this nice little cotton bag that you put the actual thing in when you take this out you get the actual candle itself it says esop then you get the nice little bag which you're able to use it's made of this ceramic material so it's very sturdy it's not like a cheap plastic and again i just want to stress something rick owens doesn't think you know how to use a candle because on it it says please read the instructions before you use it as far as like hair care goes i kind of know what i like i'm pretty utilitarian about that i just buy what is good so the whole travel kit thing it's fun to me but candles this is my true passion i like candles a lot like i really like candles there were three sizes of this candle i got the smallest which was sixty dollars and as you can tell is a small candle there were two other bigger options the medium-sized one was about 120 i believe and then the largest size was about 180 to 200 currently these are also all sold out currently right now this small sized candle which as you can tell is very small is going for around 300 dollars on grilled um i saw another one going for around like 280 of the smallest one and then i saw a bigger one going for like 400 but the reason i wanted to buy this for sure no matter what and just didn't mind spending a little bit more money on this tiny candle is because this vessel it is in is reusable these kind of rick owens designs are pretty well known i am a huge fan of the rick owens furniture or any of the rick owens homeware items um and oftentimes the price of those is insanely expensive i believe this is based on a vase that rick owens made that probably goes for upwards of six thousand dollars so to get something similar for this for like 60 dollars and to get like a kind of custom piece of tiny rick owens architecture even if it is small i can reuse this turn it into a shot glass or maybe even like hold my toothbrush i'm not sure so as far as the actual stoic scent goes i think it's really good i'm not an expert in scents or perfumes in any way but the scent that's in both the candle and the stoic just bottle of the scent itself is a special um special fragrance designed specifically for rick owens by famous perfumer barnaby fillion you know the thing about scents is that also they're like a vis they aren't a visual thing you can't like just see it and be like oh i like that or no i don't so like the only way you can do it is like through describing sense and like when i smell this i just kind of think it's like good um i could get high off of it it like sent people on the internet who are like batshit crazy by the way let me let me let me um let me try to uh describe this for you guys in a perfuming scent way the stoic fragrance balances spicy aromas the stoic fragrance that blends sharp and spicy flavors of black pepper coriander seed with earthy frankincense and patchouli it is an unusual scent but not i don't know yeah that sounds about right to me it smells kind of spicy um yeah i don't know i like it that's what i would say about the fragrance i like it good afternoon this is pizza hut carryout or delivery hey big pepperoni what the [ __ ] going on pull up in a pizza truck she dropped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmtifITkX_k,amazing that face cleanser the only difference is um the amazing paste cleanser i think it's parsley oil based and mine is um it's a chamomile bergamot and rosemary leaf so both are for sensitive skin and the one that i pinned to you is even for more sensitive skin so i'm just going to go ahead and proceed with uh opening the bottle and everybody was talking about esop smell fragrance for a long time so i wanted to make sure uh how i personally feel about it i think it smells fantastic i think it smells fantastic and i'm just going to go ahead and wet my skin just a little bit i couldn't wait to do it because we had a long day before us and i went to the gym i jumped in a quick quick shower and then we went outside again and anyhow my skin feels like you know when you have this feeling when you have to just like do something about it because it's like too greasy it's too tired and it's too dry at the same time like what is happening i need that balance to uh to be back i need that balance to be back so right now i'm just going to go ahead and show you the esa bottle uh and we are going to do my routine of cleansing the face how you guys doing uh so every not everybody but i went on and um because the bottle of esa most of the bottles to not have the pump so for some people it is a problem wasn't a problem for me just the right amount if you can see here uh beautiful beautiful beautiful smell it's a strong fragrance so if you are sense sensitive that might be not the product for you but i don't mind it i love the beautiful fragrance and esop definitely has it hard to see is that here you go here you go here you go can you uh let me know if you can see now and the bottle oh yeah i'd say like it would be like maybe five to ten drops if you would do it from a pit pad uh but yes just here it goes really this is the amount that we are going to use if you can see now uh it is not um first of all it's um the gel uh texture so it's not gonna like spill on your hand so you can really control it so i don't think you're going to have a problem with um you know with the use of it even though you don't have a pump which uh you can request from a store and you can find it online i checked it on their shop for you uh their shop did not have it but um i mean esop did not have it on their shop um so i'm trying to leather it which it does not leather so we don't have a foam um so i'm just going to go ahead and massage massage massage and massage it and maybe my face is wet but i'm going to thread it a little more uh just so we going to make sure yeah so it does not leather uh just believe me it's there i can smell it i can feel it it's the gel one which is super super super good for oily skin i personally have the dry skin and i have read a lot about it uh and people say that it does not leave your skin super dry like it takes away the layer of dirt and everything oh you already purchased it that's so sweet um it does not have that um you know when it's like totally taking away everything from your skin and then it's like right away dry and you need to hydrate it which is i mean you know it's great it does this job but esop does not do that because it's also like still like you know remain your skin hydrated um i'm just going to go ahead and wash it so as you can see that it did not give us any foam anything like that no i feel it on my lips um there we go uh i see you guys purchasing it amazing because it's nice to have a beautiful discount which is 15 on this product which is isa i heard people pronounce it as aesop i'm like okay how do you pronounce the name of the brand because i got confused because a lot of people was like asap asap a7 like i mean yes you could read it it's asap but it is eso something i learned all right so my first impression on it uh it's a little misconception the taste it's not yucky it's it's nice it's like soapy um so ease up that's correct finally we know i know uh my skin feels already better because i told you guys previously like five minutes ago that i wanted to like just wash it all away because i went to the gym went outside it's super hot outside so you know just like you know you get the feeling sometimes you just want to wash it off so we're talking today about esop and the first one that i opened is he subbed a fabulous cleanser which they are out of stock right now but it's because it's so fabulous so i pinned you an amazing face clint's cleanser uh it's super super close to the fabulous one um amazing one i think it's for more sensitive skin so you will not uh you know be mistaken if you purchase that one at a tier card uh beautiful discount for esa product that we love so much i am in love that it's in the glass bottle and it's glass amber um bottle which gives you you know that uh feeling of a long time ago uh the medicine balance so here it goes it comes in a bottle like that i love the chicken recycle it's super fast and it's not plastic totally totally uh uh you can reuse the bottle for anything you want i do not think they have like a filler for that you know so you can just buy it and um edit again so just purchase another glass bottle which i don't feel that bad purchasing another uh bottle of glass because it's not plastic so um absolutely um again it does not have the pump but i'm just going to go ahead and show you it is a gel one so you can definitely control how much you want to use right this is it probably a little too much you need a little less than that but you know if you just remove the makeup uh with a cleanser and you want to go ahead and use it as a second uh step that would be honestly enough all right so esa we are moving on yeah yeah yeah i mean you know everybody's used to the pumps right now uh i get it i get it that it's um you know easier because you don't need to worry about the amount that you're uh using but again you can definitely control it and you know once you use it twice you're like okay so i actually need that much pardon me um be mindful that it does not leather uh it does not foam so just it's a gel uh cleanser so just go ahead and like wash your face um it's actually nice that it doesn't foam this one particular lee i'm going to go ahead add it to your cart right now because it's 41 dollars uh we have still 15 off uh with me and i'm going to go ahead to the step 2 which uh remember i did the skincare routine uh on the friday and i did not use the toner that time here we are we are going to use the toner which i'm going to pin it right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxumeziuM1k,[Music] hey beautiful people haha hope you guys doing wonderful beauty to my channel welcome my name is Michelle and if you're one of my subscribers welcome back so I'm here today to share with you some products from the brand called ESOP I've talked about this brand over and over again because I stumbled across the store and I fell in love Etha is an Australian brand and they make skin care products hair care products products for your household and I would consider it to be luxury skincare the reason why I love ESOP products is because I'm really into sensory skin care I love my skin care items to have a pleasant aroma to give me an aromatherapy kind of feeling while using it my skincare ritual is really luxurious very relaxing it's my time to kind of pamper myself at the beginning and at the end of my day so I do tend to gravitate towards products that are mostly natural have a really nice aroma and perform well for my skin so ESOP does all of those things and today I have 13 products to share with you guys but if there's something that I don't touch upon feel free to leave a comment below so let's get started this first product I have is called the resurrection aromatic hand wash and it has mandarin lined rosemary leaf and cedar atlas inside of it this is a hand soap and I have it in 16.9 food ounces when I first visited the ESOP store in Santa Monica California they told me that this was one of their best-selling products and when I saw people walking in the store they kept picking this up I did not pick it up at first because I truly could not see myself spending that kind of money on hand pills but as I fell in love with the brand I truly do believe that their products are high performing and honestly they are just so aesthetically pleasing in my bathroom the way the soap sits next to the mouthwash and I'll talk about everything just kind of comes together the silk works well it works like soap I'm not really that big on hand so I could go buy something from Bath and Body Works and I'm good with that so to me it works well it smells good but it's just passable tow in my opinion I didn't see anything that was super special about this product other than the fact that it smells really nice and it looks really good the next test I have is the ESOP mouthwash and it has close and nice and spearmint leaf in it this is a regular mouthwash to help you clear any kind of bad breath or anything going on with your mouth I love this mouthwash first of all look at how beautiful it is you see like just the jar the start is glad but I do think they sell some that are just like in a regular bottle I love this top this little beaker top it so freaking cute you just pour the mouthwash in you drink it and your mouth is super happy and it's super happy because this mouthwash does not burn your mouth at all it's really smooth and a lot of people have tried this mouthwash out when they came to visit me and they've always made a comment about it afterwards saying that it was kind of weird the reason that they felt like it was weird was because it doesn't have that like really sinking feeling that Listerine gives you it feels like it very much could just be even water but it has that really nice spearmint taste at the end and it does do the job as far as like clearing your bad breath but if you're into like that stinging feeling that Listerine gives you you're not going to get that with it I really like it I've purchased it twice I do think it's really expensive from not blush but once you use this mouthwash you're not going to feel comfortable using anything else if you do go in the store to purchase it make sure that you asked for the little top because they don't just give it to you you have to actually ask for it and the last home product that I have are de stop post who dropped it has tangerine peel ylang-ylang mandarin peel in it and it smells amazing when I first saw this product I was like um I don't know about this but someone in the store told me that she gave it out to people as housewarming gifts and everyone loved it and what they are are drops just a freshen up of the bathroom it has a dropper on it and how I use it is I just put a couple drops in the toilet and a couple drops in the sink whenever I feel like it the whole bathroom smells so good it's amazing how concentrated it is because just a couple drops gives the bathroom this really early sweet aromatic scent it smells wonderful this is something that I will continue to repurchase it's not extremely long-lasting but it does linger for about an hour or so and if you're really into kind of like the sensory experience when you're doing your skincare regimen you could even put a couple of drops in the sink before you wash your face in the morning and you can just kind of breathe and take in the aroma while you're washing your face I promise you can fall in love this next product is the resurrection aromatic candle and this is just a hand balm it's a hand cream I've heard so much about the ESOP hand creams it seems like most people who are introduced to Esau it's kind of like their go-to product is their hand ball so I really did have high expectations for it I plan to use it as a hand lotion and as a foot lotion and I love the way this smells oh my goodness it smells so good the cream is yellow it's like a really thick yellow cream the consistency of it is pretty thick I love it as a hand lotion I think it works really well it's very creamy very moisturizing and it smells so good guys oh my goodness I love the way this smells it has the same smells of soap because they're both the resurrection so you can buy them together but whatever you purchase it know for the price point I can find much more reasonable hand balms to do the job I wanted to also use it I guess an all-over body lotion because of the way it smells but honestly it's just too expensive for that it's only 2.6 ounces so there's not that much in it and I feel like with my body I could probably finish it up in two to three uses but as a hand cream and a foot cream it's very very good after you use it on your hands your hands don't feel greasy or sticky it does moisturize so it does sink into your skin but like I said there's no like greasy residue the next part I have is the parsley seed facial cleansing oil and this has macadamia seeds to suffer all beta-carotene in it and it's a mild facial cleanser but suited for dry combination and sensitive skin I will be doing a skincare video where I show you all my skin care products and I'm also going to do a video that specifically looks at oil cleansers and this is an oil cleanser one thing I just want to point out that I love about Usopp is that just love the packaging you guys the glass on it is so nice I love the darkness of the bottles it kind of looks like a medicine bottle people make comments about that looks kind of like old-school medicine I think it's beautiful it fits the aesthetic of my home I just love the fact that I can sit it out and it looks like it could be decor I think that's just oh I love that so back to the product this is a oil cleanser it's very very thick this was my go-to cleanser in the winter time because of how moisturizing it is in the morning when I wake up I don't like my skin to feel like it's stripped because I have a whole nighttime regimen for my skin in the morning my skin looks really supple it looks really fresh and I don't like to just take away all of that so I do like products that are really moisturizing even though I have combination skin I do get oily in the t-zone I still like products that are really moisturizing this works really well but let me tell you do not put it on wet skin your face needs to be dry you just take a couple drops and you mix it in with a little bit of water just a tiny bit of water couple drops and rub it through your hands you put on your face and it does turn into an oil it does take off your makeup I would double cleanse with this I like to use this and follow it up with another cleanser if I have makeup on but if I'm using it in the morning first thing when I wake up I don't need to double cleanse this is enough I do think it's a wonderful product I would definitely repurchase this the only thing that I will say is at the top of it broke off so I just hope that they do a better job of making sure things like this are taken care of because it is a luxury product you're spending a lot of money so I would expect things to be intact this next product is my staple bass Lodge and I love it I love it it's the part sleeping facial cleanser and black currant seed and it's a gentle cleanser with a rich lather that's supposed to be good for all skin types and it does have mild exfoliation because it does have left an accident it it also does have some hellhole the oil in it three words for you guys love this cleanser this cleanser is my favorite and by the way if you purchase the cleansers make sure you ask for the pump it does not come with a pump top you need to ask for it this cleanser is super moisturizing and it's very thick it's not runny at all it's a really thick thick thick moisturizer my skin always feels very supple after using this but it does feel like it's cleansed and I love using this to mix with other brands that have exfoliators like powdered exfoliators I love mixing it together but I love this for cleaning my face it is more so geared towards people who have drier skin because it's so moisturizing if you have really oily skin I probably would recommend this it's very gentle only thing I don't like about this product is that when my hands are wet it doesn't so most nicely my face can be wet but my hands needs to be dry when I could to slope on my hands or else it won't lather up so that's something that I kind of wish was different because it is annoying but it works really well with Clarisonic or any kind of facial brush it works really well with that you just put a couple of pumps and it lathers like crazy so this is something that's holy grail for me I'll definitely repurchase it this next part is the purifying facial exfoliant paste and this is a facial exfoliator it's very mild it removes impurities on the skin it has five quarts rosemary and lactic acid in it as well I am obsessed with this this is my favorite facial exfoliator ever the product is white but it does have these little beads in it to exfoliate your face with but they're not harsh at all the smell of this is really weird I didn't particularly like smell of this it kind of smells like food to me and not food that I like it doesn't smell good at all in my opinion it does not worthy that maybe the rosemary in its giving it that smell and not a fan of the rosemary smell so it's probably that but this product works so well it takes off all the dead skin off my face my face isn't still dry after using it my face feels renewed so I love love love this exfoliator I use it maybe once a week if I remember my skincare it just you know it's I listen to my skin so if my skin needs to be exfoliated if it feels like a lot of gunk on it and it feels like it's really dirty just reset it for me so I love this product the six-pack is a face mask and it's called the blue calomel facial hydrating mask it has Nia sediment so the encouragin and visible in it and it supposed to be a hydrating facial mask to refresh soft it and replenish normal to dry skin so it was interesting for a facial mask to be in a little pump like this that was different usually the masks are like in jars but I have talked about this mask a lot in a lot of different videos this is one of my hands-down favorite moisturizing mask it's really hard to find a really good moisturizing face mask this is very very very potent it's very potent you only need a little bit and you just kind of put it onto your face it's clear as soon as you put it onto your face you will feel it's kind of stinging it you can tell something is working there's something going on with it and I love it I leave it on for about 30 to 45 minutes and then I just take my toner and I take a cotton swab and then wipe the mess off of my face with it that's another thing that I love about this mask because I don't have to wash it off with water I like masks that I can just take off with a toner it's super moisturizing so I love to use it right after I use a clay mask or any mask that's really purifying because it brings all of the moisture back into my face it's never let me down and everyone that I this mask on yes how many people try my stuff I think people who come over and I put the mask on that whether male or female has been so impressed by how well it works if I ever had to just take one mask that was super moisturizing it would be this one next pasta half is a parsley seed antioxidant serum and it has grape seed pessimal and parsley seed in it and it says a rich antioxidant do used moisturizer or normal to combination and sensitive skin it has grape and parsley seeds extra in it and after you cleanse until you're supposed to apply it to your hands and massage it into your face I'm new to using serums as a moisturizer as always use creams or gels on my face so this was different for me but it's pretty much almost finished because I really liked it and you just take a couple drops you put it onto your face I actually put it directly on to my face because I feel like that way I don't waste any product by sinking into my palms I bought that product on accident I meant to get the potent like small parsley seed antioxidant product but I got the wrong one and I ended up with bids but I actually liked it I used it the most in the winter time I used it during the day I would actually layer this underneath the parsley seed antioxidants actual lotion and my face was just like unbelievably moisturized moisture to a whole nother level but just using this product by itself it's fine it works as a moisturizer my face felt hydrated it felt moisturize I feel like I necessarily needed to put anything over it in the summer time I think this is going to be awesome for anyone who has oily to combination skin because it sinks into your skin and you don't need to put on a lotion and so it's light its Airy you can go out and not worry about feeling greasy now it's something I'll run out and go repurchase I wouldn't I wouldn't I probably would never repurchase that because it wasn't mind blowing it makes me just go wow my face looks so amazing it was just a good product so if you're looking for something like that I would go with it I didn't break out and have any adverse effects at all with it this next product is the bitter orange astringent toner and it has bitter orange in it witch hazel rosemary leaf and it's a toner that's supposed to help to smooth your face with a matte finish and you just will sees a cotton pad and rub it on your neck in your forehead so I just started using this toner about a month ago and I was just in need of a toner and it trusts ESOP so I went with it without really doing any research and that's another thing about this brand there's not that many reviews on YouTube I searched up and down when I first started getting into it try to find reviews so that I can know before I spend all that money but the reviews on YouTube were really scarce so I felt like I really needed to come back and do a review on all of these things so this toner is pretty good in my opinion it works I wasn't blown away by it but then again I'm not necessarily blown away by toners I do love my Chanel toner for the winter time it's awesome but this does the job it takes off all of the makeup or whatever residue or dirt was left on my face after washing and it works the smell is not my favorite I don't really like the way it smells and once again it does have rosemary in it so that might be what I'm smelling I wouldn't necessarily call this a gentle toner because you do feel that kind of sting that you feel and I think that's the witch hazel in it but it's not stripping at all my face doesn't feel like it was stripped after using it I think it's fine I'm not quite sure if I would ever repurchase it if it was available and I saw it maybe if I needed one but I would run out to go get it again the next part I have is called remove and it has grapeseed oil tocopherol which is vitamin E and blue chamomile and it's a gentle eye makeup remover that's oil-based so I bought this because I was running out of my Chanel eye makeup remover which is my favorite so I decided to try this one it's really tiny if you look at how small this is I wasn't expecting it to be this little this is the toner and this is a six point eight of the cleansing oil so you can see how small it is it's tiny it's only two fluid ounces and it's an eye makeup remover I did not like this product it really sticks on to your cotton pad as you're using it even though it's an oil I select it kind of soaks into the cotton pad and it doesn't give you a whole lot to work with I just didn't like the feeling it was what a feeling I felt on my fingertip with the cotton pad and the oil it just something about it did not work out for me this smells okay I wasn't crazy about the scent but it's not very strong I just don't think this pot is necessary I can take my makeup off with other things that are a lot less expensive I thought this was going to kind of like blow me away but in my opinion it's oh look at that it's a damp it's this a damp cotton pad look see I wasn't even following the direction I'm gonna have to wait on my review on this one because I just read that the cotton pad is supposed to be damp and I definitely never let it that's the thing about these kinds of products you have to use them the way that you're instructed to use them before you can say whether or not it works so I'm gonna have to get back to you on this this next product is the parsley seed antioxidant hydrator with white tea patent all willow herb in it and it's a light rapid absorbing facial moisturizing fluid that delivers super antioxidant hydration this is definitely my favorite moisturizer for the winter I've purchased this twice already and I love it I absolutely love it it's so thick and rich smell amazing and after I use it instantly my skin is plumped instantly hydrated instantly plump really supple looking very soft it does have a little bit of craziness to it there's a little bit of grease you can't use too much you only need a tiny amount I would say about half a dime-sized you just need a little bit if you put a lot on your face it's going to look a little bit oily a little bit greasy even under makeup using it my makeup would go on so flawlessly like I said if you use too much it can be a problem especially if you use a primer because of how thick this is it kind of turns into this kind of like grainy white text I can't really explain it but it's just it's a no-go it's not good so you need to use only a little bit within like two days of using the cleansing oil and this particular product my face was noticeably more supple so this is something I was definitely repurchase it says it's ideal for fatigue skin exposed to drying environment such as an office base or an airline cabin it refreshes and tones of skin like an congested by humidity or pollution so this is an interesting little product I wasn't when I initially bought it I bought it to use as a toner but I realized that it could have better uses this is one of those facial sprays that you use that are in an airplane you want to freshen up your face because you know your skin does kind of get yucky when you travel it's really small so you can put it in your purse or your bag and I like it I like the way it mists out the quality isn't the quality of the mister is really good because it does have a really clean light sprit I've never used it over makeup to see if it was like a setting spray but that's not how it's marketed so it's truly just to refresh your face I think it's a nice product it has a pretty decent smell kind of orangie I would repurchase it because I don't really need it and I really only want to keep things that I'm like in love with and not just things to have so I will finish it but it's not something that I'm going to repurchase another way I use it is right before I go to the gym I bring my face with it just to kind of refresh my face and tone it because I do wash my face right before I go to the gym all right you guys that was a lot that was a lot but thank you so much for sticking with me let me know if you have any questions about these products I love Esau I love the brand this isn't sponsored I purchased all of this with my own money but eats up if you do want to sponsor me I would be more than happy to do that because I love this brand if you get a chance to actually go into an esop store you should because it is mixed there and the ambiance of it is really nice it's really neat you can try out all the products inside the store they have lots of big sinks and the people who work with you are really knowledgeable they're really sweet and they'll help you find whatever it is that you need or give you samples to try out before you spend the money on it so let me know if you guys have any questions if you don't because to you all nuts thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKkYYrEGE8,hey everyone talking about marrakesh intense by aesop the notes in this are bergamot clove cardamom pedigreen jasmine rose sandalwood and cedar not my type of thing at all i love aesop they put you know they have so much quality in what they do use such high quality ingredients and everything about their presentation to kind of the brand itself their stores everything is great but this is just not my type of scent i do often love fragrances with cloves cardamom bergamot which is in practically everything you can't really be a frag head if you hate bergamot and even the smallest doses uh cedar jasmine and rolly and i'm sometimes fine with the fragrances that use rose or sandalwood in terms of not like actively always disliking them even though they're not usually full bottle worthy to me but the mix here is really like intense dry and heavy i wouldn't want to wear it and i wouldn't really want to smell it on someone else but again that's just my taste i think this would be good if you are into the type of fragrance houses like par from stemarley they're masculine-leaning ones at least the way garland does certain things some of creed's older more like classic masculine style fragrances this isn't even that masculine it's unisex being slightly masculine but just those kind of fragrance houses and styles come to mind for who i think might like this uh but it's not something that i think would just be an easy reach for most people out there the dry down does become very rose in sandalwood and because i don't like either of those and they don't kind of get lost in the shuffle anymore at that point by then i'm really just like no okay i don't like that either but that's not as intense as the opening so maybe you would like that more if you like those notes moderate longevity and projection this goes for 145 for a 50 mil i don't even think that's unfair because the quality is impeccable the ingredients are great this is not an issue of it being outright bad but it does smell not good to me but just not for quality reasons just like too intense and then two rows in sandalwood so i wouldn't go out of the way to try it if that doesn't sound good to you but if you really love those notes and you're okay with the way when clove and cardamom are done in a bit of a more old school way maybe yeah you would totally might like this more than me i'll put a link in the description where you can get a bottle or a sample if you want to check it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtINGK6GCWU,talking about the products you got it i think i'll just share that with you now yeah i think all these products can go on a carry-on so they're all under the airline regulation size the jack black stuff might need to go in like in the hold this i think could definitely go in a carry-on so you receive the package like this and you're good to go so first thing toothpaste need toothpaste you know you can't travel without it i'm a [ __ ] and i did this weekend and i'm bugging people to like you know borrow their toothpaste at 6am which is just annoying for them and i feel like an idiot the next thing we got is the aesop facial hydrator now this i popped it already you pop it like with the end of the it comes with like a little foil over the top and then you pop it obviously really nice kind of more of a richer feel to it compared to the strictly men's products of the jack black yeah mike they got yeah they got toothpaste in there too and mouthwash but i'll get to that in a little while um this is the facial hydrator i didn't use this this morning because i already used the jack black stuff i just used it like over the weekend a little bit and you need this is obviously it's like smaller than the jack black stuff but you only need you probably need less of it because it's so it's pretty rich um but the scent is amazing like it's really nice i think that's like a thing that aesop are kind of known for it's like the different scents and it just feels premium you know it feels feels expensive you definitely feel fancy you feel kind of bougie one like i mean i do at least when i've got this and just the smell of it you know the smell it smells great this has tones of sandalwood um witch hazel and anderoba seed i don't know what that seed is but it smells good that could be an ingredient i don't know but it smells good so that's the asop two minds face facial hydrator next thing we got we'll do that afterwards body leaf cleanser again you've got to take it when you're traveling this could go in like your gym bag as well you know you could get one of these and like just carry it around with you because it's so small and so compact michelle do i rotate brands all of the time yes again what what i think a good thing about getting these kind of travel size or sample sets where you get multiple products in the truck in these in the set is you can pick out what you like the best so you could get this ace up set right and be like okay like i have my moisturizer routine i already know what i'm i already have like a set thing that i that i do but i love the shampoo and conditioner so you wouldn't know about that unless you know you might not want to get a full-size shampoo and conditioner if unless you knew that you really liked it with these travel sets you can mix and match you can you know if you really like something you can get the full-size version uh and if you're not keen on something you can switch it out for something else so that's a good thing about getting these these kind of smaller travel sets i i mix my products up a little bit um just depends on how i feel you know sometimes you get kind of tired of the same scent um so you want to mix it up a bit sometimes like something with no sense so you can then put on some cologne afterwards and it's not going to conflict or anything like that so yeah an answer to your question michelle i do i do mix the brands up um i don't use the same stuff just all the time thanks all right yeah so this is the body cleanser smells great all of this stuff smells amazing i wonder if they have um they probably do have like the scents that you can buy like a body spray or something like that and like if you combined the scent of like the body cleanser with the shampoo and conditioner or from like the same you know section of aesop then you know that's gonna feel really good any this is described as an aromatic body cleanser enhanced with geranium leaf extract for all skin types massage a generous amount onto damp skin before rinsing thoroughly for all skin types so good to know if you have any issues this is you know across the board a good cleanser for your body if you're on the beach you get off you wash the sun the sea salt off yourself it's gonna feel good classic shampoo need shampoo need it absolutely need it don't be if you're a guy this this is unisex by the way so you could get it you know if you're male or female it doesn't matter i used to be a guy before my wife called me out on it i would use shampoo i would like if i had a body wash in the shower i'll put that on my hair i would put that on my body i'll put that everywhere if i had a shampoo i'd use it on my hair my body everything if i had sometimes even have conditioner you know like i was like a guy living like that then you know with my wife and uh she called me out she was like tell me you've got to use shampoo for shampoo body wash or body wash and conditioner purely for conditioner all right so again travel size shampoo same scent as the body wash so you're staying smelling good throughout there's no conflict and smell there this actually has it's slightly stronger smell than the body wash so your hair's probably going to be smelling amazing after that um this is described as a gentle formulation to carefully cleanse the scalp and hair pour a small amount of shampoo so you only need a little bit onto your hands and massage gently onto the scalp yeah so you only get like you don't get a huge amount here again it's a travel size you get 50 ml but if you don't need that much and the smell is pretty strong anyway um you should be good that should last you a little while like again all 70 bucks for all this product and you you might find something that you want to buy the full-size version of so it's a good like trial thing and get the nice get the nice package as well guys look at that you'd probably you'd probably pay like 30 bucks for that package anyway at least facial toner facial toner is important again didn't know about facial toner until not too long ago um i wouldn't for me i don't use this like after i've shaved and then moisturized because i just think like i'm putting too much stuff onto my face but on the days like at the end of the day when so i shave in the morning enjoy the day do whatever get home i would probably do a facial toner i'd do a facial wash so you could use jack black facial wash and then you could use the toner i think i think this is what you do right this is what i do you put it like on a small like cotton pad thing and then you wipe it around and then you know you get all the air out and then like you feel good and it smells good and this actually has a little thing on it so it controls how much you get that comes out you probably only need like a really little bit of this too you don't need too much um okay this is so one of the good things about this is the equilibrium equilibriating facial toner formulated for combination skin so if you do have like troublesome skin i have like i i think i like running pretty oily like i have oily skin so this is going to get all the excess oil and that out of your skin especially if you're in a hot climate it's going to come in really handy and the smell is amazing i keep going back to the smell on the aesop stuff but it just smells expensive i can't help but think like i'm in a fancy hotel when you when you're smelling the aesop stuff yeah it's really nice all right any ques let me just check the questions you got from you guys is there anything that comes up yeah might mike's making fun of me because i used to use shampoos like face cleanser and stuff this is a while ago guys i've upped my game a little bit since then body bomb yes again smells amazing this is the grainium leaf body bomb which is gonna nourish your skin when you're away this summer don't you skin drying out you want to use spf but you're still going to catch catch the sun and you don't want to be in pain with dry skin so this is again i tried it out it's can you see like the you can see like the the texture of it almost is pretty thick so i think again with this a little goes a long way which is why with this gift set you've got so many products to use and if you really like it then you can just get the bigger version but i feel like this is gonna last you a long time if you was gonna gonna go away for like a long weekend you're probably gonna be good with this um this is described as an exceptionally hydrating body bomb containing a sophisticated blend of geranium and citrus extract sounds good to me smells good to me too really nice so that's the eight stop body bomb which again comes in this pack do we have any more oh another thing we've got we got the mouthwash like i said i forgot my toothpaste this weekend if i forgot my toothpaste you damn sure that i forgot my mouthwash too so this comes in handy you can use it throughout the day if you want um you know if you're traveling somewhere you've been in a car you've been on a flight you want to brush your teeth and use mouthwash and this isn't like no like cheap one that you get from like you know get from some other grocery stores or like convenience stores this is a good one uh it's gonna really cleanse the pallets before you head out for dinner in the morning not too strong just about right it'll probably pair up really well with the toothpaste and i believe that is all of the asop products which i have here so again guys it's 70 bucks for this you probably you're probably gonna pay 30 bucks for the for the um the travel bag anyway then you get an extra one two three four five six seven eight there's nine products in there for seventy dollars minus fifteen percent off if you shop now or within the next thirty minutes so yeah value for money wise this is great and what i like about these sets the jack black stuff which i talked about earlier on and this if oh christina what is the bag made out of good question and i'm not like 100 sure what it's made out of but it's very sturdy it's it's like it's not going to bend it's not going to crease it's like a premium it feels very premium it feels nice it looks it's minimal minimal branding there is a cool little quote from um this guy called carl maybe i hope he has something to do with a brand um but yeah the bag is really nice and you're gonna use this once you've used all the products you've still got the bag and you're going to use it time and time again but yeah you get a 15 off this uh and all the products and if you like something out of them you can reorder them same goes for the jack black stuff which i spoke to you guys about earlier on there's some really nice things in there um dale you get like look how big this is this is 35 like i'm pretty sure with some brands you would probably pay 35 for less than that for one product you get like four products in this set of the jack black stuff so uh this is called a skin stevia set which will be available for you guys to buy if you want with 15 off 30 minutes after i finish my live stream so yeah oh something else which is also available on very short i didn't i haven't tagged it but i'll try and do that afterwards i saw this on very short and i've had this for a while this is the uh i think it's called you say perasso poroso it's like a skin um after shave balm to prevent irritation which again i i have in my cupboard it's more i don't really travel with it because it's like a it's glass you know um but this is really nice and i know the brand is is available on various shops so you should definitely check them out something which i really like about it is all which drew me to it was the vintage branding i thought was really cool um and they do have gift sets as well too um so the poroso uh this is the crema liquida anti-irritation aftershave bomb basically but yeah it's uh it's really good guys it's father's day coming up this weekend you get free shipping over 35 bucks when i ordered this stuff it came within two days i think that depends on where you live but for me it came um super quick and it was free which is nice because sometimes you order stuff then you gotta pay like an extra 10 bucks for shipping like two days shippings like eight bucks or whatever so this is really cool and yeah 15 off all the products i've been talking about and i think that's a wrap for me today let me go through the questions and see if there's any anything else does anyone else have any questions what products do you keep oh alyssa says what products try and go through these comments thank you for the recommendations no problem iris what products do you keep handy in your personal bag when flying when flying toothpaste mouthwash comes from the aesop stuff because sometimes you get like flight break like this is like you want to play with like 100 200 300 other people like you know you you're eating like processed food drinking sodas or drinks whatever it is you've been traveling for a long time so i like to get off brush my teeth a cleanser facial cleanser to wash all the stuff off your face from the flight i know the air's not the greatest on the fly on planes um so a facial cleanser maybe a toner i know i kind of like to let you could put that especially with the travel size stuff you could definitely put the truck like the travel size stuff in there if you wanted to use it um but all this stuff all the aesop stuff can fly anyway so you got like nine products in there to choose from moisturizer shampoo i mean depending on what kind of flight you're taking you know you might be on a flight which has a shower on there so you've got shampoo conditioner and body wash yeah let's have a look is there any other cool i think that's about it but guys this was my first one um i'm gonna be doing it every week i think next week i have some swim

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pgGaOnp_WY,so yo I got this question in my DMs the other day after I posted a review of the Aesop mouthwash I decided to go to the store today and show you my favorite products from the brand and what I think is worth copying so yo this Resurrection aromatique aromatic gotta say it like that hand wash is amazing it exfoliates and scrubs while cleansing at the same time I didn't always use exfoliant paste I use a lot of chemical exfoliants in my face but I started throwing in this physical one here and there and uh I'm a big fan of that the Marrakesh perfume smells like nothing you've ever smelled before if you get a chance please go smell that for yourself I love my istros room spray but when I went to the store today I found out they had many sizes which is amazing for like the bathroom and last but not least I love the mouthwash it's a little pricey but treat yourself why not

cleanser and more whether you are looking for yourself or as a gift esop's diverse selection of unisex all vegan fortifying formulations are guaranteed to leave a lasting impression [Music] the first product on our list is moroccan neroli shaving duet esop 60 milliliters 60 milliliters while it is easy to just get by with simple shaving creams investing in a shaving serum full of powerful ingredients guarantees a clarifying and superior shaving experience available as a bundle esop's moroccan neroli shaving set is the perfect gift to yourself or others working in tangent the shaving serum requires as little as two pumps to provide a frictionless shave with calming ingredients such as sandalwood neroli blossom and citric acid to gently strip away dead skin cells the semi-heavy post shave lotion works perfectly after toning to prevent razor burn while caressing your skin with a witch hazel and shea butter my skin felt much softer than the previous shaving gel i had been using the lather is much less foaming when applied by hand but i found that it gave me an heightened sense of control during the shave if you use a shaving brush it lathers much more so you can make it work for you the semi-heavy post shaving lotion really works with my neck in particular and keeps it soft even with daily shaving the next product on our list is bitter orange astringent toner esop 200 milliliters toners can often be overlooked when creating a skin care routine but they are essential components of preparing your skin for hydration astringent toners while moisturizing act slightly different to non-alcohol versions as they mattify the skin and work great for those with normal or oily skin eesop's bitter orange toner may not work for those with sensitive skin but we highly recommend it to those who like a refreshing morning wake up that helps to clear up any skin imperfections with bitter orange witch hazel rosemary leaf and lavender before trying an astringent toner i had a few friends that advised against doing so but my experience did not match their words my skin felt clarified and refreshed upon using this though i stick to this on my face and use an alcohol-free toner on my neck the second runner up to this product was esop's alcohol free b and amp tea balancing toner [Music] the next product is gentle cleansing facial milk esop 200 milliliters esop's gentle facial cleansing milk is one of the company's best overall cleansers as it works so well on every skin type as the formulation is so gentle it is perfect to match the uk weather particularly through dry winters with gentle stripping power this cleanser can work through makeup and the daily build-up of life making this great for both men and women the included botanicals also conjure a refreshing smell this cleanser is one of the best you can use in wintertime but i have found that it also holds up in hotter seasons too compared with other cleansers that work to strip slightly more aggressive i found that this milk didn't need to do heavy lifting to keep me feeling clarified morning and night the next product is lucent facial concentrate esop if anti-aging is a skin care concern opting for a vitamin c rich formula in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate is the perfect investment for blemish-free clarified skin without having to worry about irritation the product only requires one drop in the morning and one at night meaning a little goes a long way with the addition of rose petals and niacinamide your skin can repair sun damage and calm inflammation after a surprisingly noticeable change in skin vitality after using a test of loosened facial concentrate i quickly went and grabbed a bottle to upkeep the effects my skin looked radiant and had a delicate sheen that lasted throughout the day i also appeared less tired even if i was the next product in our list is lightweight facial hydrating serum esop 100 milliliters a real staple product of esop that is popular among those who like to avoid heavy creams is this lightweight hydrating serum from experience the serum has a quickly mattifying texture and smells wonderful this particular serum contains camellia sinensis leaf extract which works wonders to help protect the skin from free radicals especially in urban environments if you want a serum to replace your hydration creams look no further over the years i have come to realize that moisturizing serums work best for my skin the ease of how this particular serum soaks in is unmatched because i usually do not have a lot of time in the mornings to wait for my skin to absorb the moisture another small plus but i found the overall application of the product enjoyable [Music] the next product is seeking silence facial hydrator esop 16 milliliters seeking silence is one of esop's only gel moisturizers many skin types can find heavy cream to be too much for the skin to absorb so gel moisturizers are often favored for the ability to quickly absorb into the skin without residue while it is primarily marketed for sensitive skin this moisturizer contains the water attracting probiotic saccharide isomerate as well as other conditioning ingredients such as squalane and bisible meaning that this gel moisturizer is also helpful for people with dry or combination skin too my experience with a few other esop creams was that they were too heavy on my skin probably because i have semi-oily skin after using seeking silence i noticed my skin feeling more refreshed and found it soaked in without feeling clogged [Music] the next product is protective facial lotion spf 25 esop 50 milliliters the final and most important step of any skincare routine requires a well-formulated moisturizing sunscreen esops in-house protective facial lotion not only prevents premature aging but also envelops the skin with an antioxidant barrier to ward off free radicals and acute environmental stressors beneficial ingredients include antioxidant heavy green tea panthenol great for its anti-inflammatory properties tocopherol protection against uvb rays and squalane a hydrocarbon that mimics human sebum this is my absolute go-to spf for daily use knowing that my final layer of skincare is full of amazing antioxidant properties reassures me that i am doing my best to look after my skin in harsh conditions i also feel that it works as a great moisturizer if you suddenly run out of your usual stuff i find the spf 50 by esop a bit too much to use as the scent is so strong the next product in our list is parsley seed antioxidant intense serum esop 16 milliliters if you like to work with antioxidant skin care the parsley seed range should be your first stop filled to the brim with effective ingredients you can protect your skin from the free radicals that surround your everyday life with niacinamide red algae visible chamomile tocopherol vitamin e and vitis vinifera seed extract your skin is effectively masked to stay refreshed clarified and fortified against the elements esop renewed their intense serum in 2021 and it is the only version i have tried but it has a thick consistency for a facial serum and really feels as if you are creating a barrier for your face against the elements the next product in our list is parsley seed facial cleanser esop 200 milliliters starting your day right with an antioxidant heavy cleanser means that your skin is refreshed and protected day and night additionally the inclusion of lactic acid means that your skin will slowly shed dead skin to keep your natural

it won't cause you any problems with irritation this facial cleanser really works for me and my oily normal skin though it states it works with all skin types i find my skin to never feel dried out and it leaves a small dewy residue on the skin even after rinsing almost like a very thin layer of honey my skin has looked particularly clear since i started using this i also really love the parsley seed cleansing oil the next product is resurrection aromatic hand wash esop 500 milliliters this invigorating hand wash is a staple among many popular restaurants bars and hotels which makes it all

rind and rosemary leaf this intoxicating blend of essential oils and fragrance never gets old it also makes for a wonderful present no matter the occasion my fascination with esop started here with this very soap so i owe a lot to it i really think it is one of the most interesting and well formulated hand soaps to have ever been created anywhere that stocks it has great taste over the exfoliant variant reverence i find this hand cleanser superior the next product is a rose by any other name esop 500 milliliters once tried to be an essential part of any shower or bathing experience arose by any other name is esop's most gentle scent that travels the furthest the perfect blend of cardamom black pepper and rose make this a highly indulgent fragrance to wash your body with perfect for uk weather this body cleanser refreshes your body with smooth bubbles in summer and warms your body with its gentle fragrance in the winter months not many body cleaners have such universal reach after buying this as a present for my mother i ended up buying a smaller bottle for myself to try and was surprised by the adultness of the rose scent the undertones of pink pepper and cardamom really come through to give the body cleanser refinement this scent feels more accessible than others like citrus melange the next product is rejuvenate intensive body balm esop 100 milliliters one thing can be certain when you open this body balm you'll have never smelled anything like it intensely vanilla with hints of sandalwood and tangerine rind this body balm is the perfect companion to keep your body

jojoba oil blood orange and laurel leaf this vitamin e infused hydration oil is the perfect body oil to encase your skin in dry conditions the oil calms your skin and quickly sinks in leaving a slight

body oil is my favorite way to keep my arms hydrated in the winter the scent is so soothing and warm it really is a perfect bed companion i found the oil to quickly absorb but leave my skin feeling highly nourished and non-sticky the next product is herbal deodorant esop 50 milliliters if you are looking for a more natural deodorant this hyper refreshing mist is the perfect place to start equipped with zinc rice and oleate and witch hazel this aluminium-free deodorant works to mask the body gently alongside absolute effectiveness this deodorant smells wonderful and is subtle enough to be reapply throughout the day with essential oils such as lavender rosemary and sage it is an unforgettable scent this herbal deodorant i preferred over the normal deodorant because it simply has a more refined scent over the non-herbal version my only issue was that i ran out of this quicker than i would have liked to so if you use a lot you may need to stock up [Music] the next product is geranium leaf rinse free hand wash esop 50 milliliters if you're looking to keep your hands sanitized with an alcohol-based cleanser that also smells great we highly recommend you try this fragrant hand cleanser this is a lifesaver for those moments commuting when you need to quickly keep your hands sanitized with a strong scent of geranium and bergamot this product may seem a little gaudy

who also owns the body shop and avon do you know this house do you know their fragrances well today i'm going to review four of their fragrances called marrakesh intense tacket or tacit hawaii and rosu their latest fragrance which just launched a few months ago so if you're curious to learn about this house and their fragrances then please stay tuned [Music] thanks so much for tuning in this is sebastian with smelling great fragrance reviews that's right today i'm talking about asip an australian luxury skincare brand and i first discovered this brand way back in probably 2014 when i started going to barneys to buy perfumes well i went to barney's prior to that obviously but i wasn't really digging into skin care until much later but i really enjoyed the the whole you know the idea of the brand their quality and all their scents in their products and the fragrances i recently got into more recently than late and i've got all four of them now as i said it's marrakech intense tacit hawaiial and rozu hawaii would have ended up perfectly on my incense video recently but i didn't have it at the time i just recently picked it up so we're going to find out about these four fragrances but before i get to the fragrances if this is your first time tuning in to my channel and you still haven't subscribed please do click the subscribe button below and also click the bell so you'll be notified for future videos and giveaways so a lot of you have been asking me to cover this brand and finally have all four of their fragrances uh and now it's time for me to cover them and of course you guys have asked me uh about specific fragrances from the the house and not a lot of people talk about the fragrances from this house and i figured you know what it's time that we discuss them there's some great fragrances here and they are um you know there's still mass fragrances but they are a little on the edgy side they're not like you know your typical department store fragrances where everybody or every fragrance smells similar there's some unique things here they're more indeed to me they they act a little more indie-esque uh indie-esque niche like indie houses so their fragrances seem to seem like that in comparison to uh their other brands the body shop which are very mass i believe uh from what i've sampled in the past so this is different definitely and i'm not too experienced with avon so it's been a long time since i've smelled anything avon but this brand i think it totally stands out next to the body shop and the body shop is a skincare brand as well so let's go ahead and talk about marrakesh intense first i want to show you how the fragrances come now these are a little uh i ordered a mail order uh and a little they're a little scuffed up they come in little boxes like this and each fragrance has a different price all four fragrances three of them are eau de parfum concentration the very first one i'm going to talk to you about is marrakech intense it's eau de toilette concentration and as i said all four have different prices this marrakesh intense is the least expensive it's 50 ml and it's 95 dollars auto toilet as i said and this fragrance to me is more woodsy spicy with slightly floral nuances and it's inspired by something you would smell in the spice markets of marrakech that's why it's called marrakech intense but i was also doing some research and i said i noticed that on their website asip's website it said that they're inspired by culinary adventures of the spice markets so you know this is actually really uh spicy but also it's uh i was thinking i would name drop like something like tower perfumes layer to desert maro cane they're not at all similar except for the fact that this is spicy just like that what i like about this one that uh the cardamom stands out a lot but everything in here connected together has a very fizzy almost like coca-cola kind of a vibe which actually is fun uh soda fragrances are fun and there is something in the background that acts like it's bubbling uh like a can of coke that you've poured into a cup and it's fizzing everywhere i like that part of uh this fragrance is it really reminding me of the spice markets in market well i've never been to marrakech i've always wanted to go but i can smell the spices in here and i think what's causing that um fizzy quality is the cloves with the bergamot at the top notes which is really really wonderful i really love it so if you like spicy fragrances i recommend this this that's how the bottle is right here and the packaging for uh asip's marrakech intense again there are smaller bottles they're easy to transport they're a little heavy uh the glass i feel like is definitely a really strong glass so if it falls it might not break but don't take my word on that one but marrakesh intense is fun it's a fun fragrance and i like that whole coca-cola fizziness inside you can see some very interesting writing but recently i picked up hawaii this is it right here from a local san francisco shop aesop shop and they're not cellophane wrapped so i think that's how the fragrances are handed and i ordered the other three that i'm talking about including marrakesh intense so marrakesh intense tacit and rozu were mail ordered uh they came like this that's quite a little they're a little scuffed because the shipping kind of ruined them because they're not cellophane wrapped so this one's the 95 one the least expensive one and also the eau de toilette one the rest of them are eau de parfum so if you like spicy fragrances they're a little on the playful side because of this whole fizzy vibe that i get from marrakech intense you should check out this one um i like it it's a great fragrance actually um they're not overly strong the fragrances are more subtle they're not like loud beasts or anything like that so i think the best way to experience these fragrances is to get some samples if you can or go to an asip store and sample there as i said here we had barney's it's no longer here but in san francisco i think there's two or three ace of skin care stores that i can go to and you know sample their skin care products or body products and then of course smell their fragrances and there's a total of four so the second fragrance i'm going to talk to you about today is tacit which is here so this is slightly higher priced it's 125 for a 50 ml but it's also an eau de parfum concentration fragrance and again it's not cellophane wrapped and this is what the inside looks like and the bottle is similar brownish color but seems a little on the greener side in comparison to marrakesh intense i should not have put although they're the same color as you can see so tacit some so i noticed that on their website it says this is a uh modern take on a classic cologne so it uses a lot of citruses it's green it's bitter it's citrusy it's fresh woody and spicy so those are all uh key words or accords i guess i should say that come to mind with this one but at the top there's loads of citruses and yuzu yuzu fruit and yuzu is like grapefruit so there's this bitterness about it there's a zinginess about it but it's also um causing a little bit of subduedness i i find that a lot of the fragrances in this collection they're not screamers so if you don't like screamers then these probably are ones that you would like if you do like screamers these might not be ones that you should try there anytime i experience fragrances that are a little subdued a little more quiet there's some classiness around them uh there's some i don't want to use the word sophisticated but whenever fragrance screams like loud beasts things like that i would never call those fragrances classy because they're just overwhelmingly strong and um you know class goes with the subtleties for me and i just think that anytime that fragrances have the subtleness about it then i can you know call it a classy fragrance and this one definitely has it um one thing i forgot to mention all their fragrances are unisex gender neutral it says on their website and once again this one also has um cloves and i've noticed that their fragrances all three except for marrakesh intense has vetiver so the vetiver deodorant obviously uh from this house is something that i really enjoy it is pricey it's really dark earthy and smoky and i feel like they complement the three fragrances and i think they should also complement marrakesh intense as well because i think it would work it would just add a smoky layer to that fragrance which i think might be missing because seems very bright for marrakesh intense for spices and things like that definitely i think it needs a little uh smokiness but going back to tacit um if you like the bitterness of colognes if you like them spicy woody of uh like traditional odor colognes or uh fragrances that are inspired by you know citrusy odor colognes this might be one for you to try the clothes there's clothes again in here and there's clothes in the other fragrance as well so it seems like some notes they do like to use over and over again now i wasn't able to find the details of who the perfumers are on these fragrances so i don't really know but i'm actually digging a lot of these fragrances if i want some less i guess if i want some subtle more subtle fragrances i would go with the fragrances from this but yeah i can see the whole um citrus uh oda cologne or cologne inspired qualities of this fragrance but it does have a little more of a dense oomph woodsyness and spiciness about it so that's tacit with an interesting name um their names are pretty interesting here tacit and uh hawaii uh which is the next fragrance we're gonna talk about are pretty interesting rozu kind of gives me a hint of what i'm going to smell rose rosu and marrakech spa intense i i think is a fairly straightforward name so that's tacit once again this is a 50 ml 125 not the most expensive the last fragrance is the most expensive and we're going up in price every time we do a fragrance in this collection so the cheapest is the marrakesh intense so this is the newest fragrance i just recently picked it up from one of our asap locations here in san francisco and this is called hawaii h-w-y-l i don't know this name i didn't do research on the name pretty interesting name almost reminds me of highway or hawaii hawaii or whatever it doesn't matter uh i don't know how it also matches the the fragrance because it's a smoky woody japanese forest incense inspired fragrance and that's why i said this would have been perfect in my instance fragrances video but it also reminds me of con de garcons uh inspired in scentsy kind of woodsy fragrances so hawaii is a 2017 launch i didn't say the dates on the other fragrances today marrakesh intense was 2014 um tacit was 2015 in hawaii is 2017. odapar femme 50ml 135. so this one actually has lots of greenish touches inside the box here i like it it's almost like green lilies or something i don't know what that image has anything to do with the fragrance but once again the same color similar color bottle as you can see if i can get all three up here but yeah they're the same color although this one seems a little yellower so hawaii is a smoky woody rich green dark forest incense and totally reminds totally reminds me of incense fragrances or woodsy incense-y fragrances or smoky fragrances from the com de garcon so i can see that this might be inspired by those fragrances but then again i don't know um it's definitely green and it's a kind of incense japanese incense to me like kyoto from the garcon cdg incense series there is something more balanced about it it's not like ultra smoky and also burned it smells a little more green and woodsy and this actually captures that very well with this one at the top you've got lots of spices like thyme and other spices well thyme is an herb obviously but other spices so there's a spicy start aromatic herbal start and then the cypress comes in now i don't know if it's a cypress like traditional western cypress or if it's like hanoki which is a japanese cypress i believe and then there's also more woods and then in the base notes is the olive and that gives it the smoky incense-y touch with vetiver oak moss there's a vetiver again and i like this one a lot it's definitely easy to wear incense because it's not all about the incense there's the spices the aromatic touches and then also the wood so all of it is nicely blended together and for a dark smoky incensie ex woody experience definitely the green comes into mind too uh it has lots of green touches so that's hawaii let me know if you guys are fans of this because this one seems to get a lot of um i mean what i'm about to say is like people comment and mention this particular fragrance that they're fans of so i can see that it's pretty popular maybe it's the most popular from the collection that's why i wasn't able to buy all four of them together i had to buy this one locally from our uh asap store here in san francisco anyway a while 135 for a 50 ml launched in 2017 and the last fragrance here the one i experienced the most because i've been wearing this for the longest because i really love it is rosu so 20 20 launch 50ml 180. now this one's really really expensive not sure what happened with this one maybe it's the notes they're using so row zoo you can kind of tell from the color it's a rosy pinkish purplish red as far as the box goes it seems like there's woods on it and green leaves but obviously it's in black and white so with this particular fragrance for me it hints at a little bit of a little bit le labo's uh rose 31 so it's a kind of a spicy rose earthy bitter green definitely lots of spices and lots of green stems you can kind of smell the stems the rose stems when you chop them or cut them to put in a voss there's a smell you definitely pick it up here but it does have oh i think it does have a little bit of cumin and that's kind of why it reminds me a little bit of rose 31. they're not identical though don't worry but i think what's giving me that kind of green stemmy uh smell is the shiso there's shiso in the notes but this one again it's floral it's green woody and spicy and there's some light smoky touches in here as well top notes are rosebud bitter orange bergamot shiso and pink pepper and i think that originally that when you first spray it you get that kind of green stemmy quality that rose stems have rose ylang yulong jasmine and gayak wood in the heart and i think the gayak wood must be this right there finally in the base notes there are some smoky resonance touches in the musk patchouli myrrh sandalwood and vetiver vetiver comes again and i think rose 31 also has vetiver but for me rose 31 is not so stemi i don't have that shiso uh a kind of greenish slightly stemmy a green stemmy kind of a smell definitely not present in rose 31 it is here but i think the there's a coumany undertone in here it doesn't mention cumin but something maybe is causing that kumini kind of smell that you know some kind of an accord but the vetiver definitely is prominent here that's also in rose 31 and of course the roses in here but this is really really great it's quite sexy because of the kumini touches i quite like it and again it's not like a full jammy rose it's just a dry kind of um it's just almost like a like the life span of a rose because it's you go when you first smell a rose it doesn't have a lot of smell you smell the greenness when it hasn't opened up and then as it's developing it's getting sweeter and sweeter and more you know jammy and things like that so you have the whole entire experience here with this fragrance and that's what i like about it it's kind of like a rose journey but it's not a full-on in your face rose but great scent the most expensive unfortunately 180 for a 50 ml eau de parfum and 2020 launch so this is rozu from the house of asip so those are the four fragrances from asap i wanted to do this video as you guys have been asking me and finally it's done and let me know what your thoughts are on this house do you use their skin care i mean have you tried any of their skin care because i've tried some and they're pretty interesting i don't really uh i guess i should say i'm not really like a skin care person i don't do a lot i should to make me look younger maybe but as far as the fragrances are concerned these are great but of course their deodorant the vetiver deodorant is awesome you should check it out and some of their products i have used here and there and i think they're also great so i should definitely look into using them but anyway those are my thoughts on the four fragrances from asip marrakesh intense tacit or is it tackett hawaii and rozu if you're fans of these fragrances or that house for their skincare or body care please let me know put some comments down also which one sounds great to you if you've never tried them because i'd like to find out after hearing me talk about the fragrances which one would you check out first anyway guys thanks so much for watching today if you have any questions or comments please list below otherwise please like this video please share it follow me on facebook twitter and instagram and i'll be back with more videos very soon have a good one goodbye [Music] you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VreXcokCJI4&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,oh man oh man oh we need to invent smell-o-vision hey it's Jess Rose welcome to this unboxing for the ESOP Aesop usop you stop by soap I don't know is it an ESO I think it's ESOP as in esop's fables everybody says Aesop Aesop's favorite is a a sub but I think the little squiggly thing makes it an e if you know let me know in the comments but do it phonetically don't just put oh it's Aesop because then we're like well yeah but how do you say anyway esophageal use up YouTube I can't do that every time I'm gonna stick with one Aesop two incredible Aesop products one I've never used before the geranium Leaf body cleanser basically you can use it as a shower gel I'm going to explain why in a second we're doing that and the other one is the resurrection aromatic hand bomb to you and I hand lotion or moisturizer let's have a little look they arrive today um I'm a big fan of esoc products uh partly the naturalness I like the really slightly more refined uh unusual smell that they have there's like a really lovely depth to their scents it's a great brand the products are incredible quality they are on the pricier side now I travel an awful lot I'm in the garden an awful lot I'm using my hands a lawful lot but also my hands appear on camera and my hands up here you know if I'm doing magic or something then certainly uh very close to people so I look after my hands as much as I possibly can I don't have the nicest hands in the world but I moisturize them often and this moisturizer we're going to talk about today the moisture as they call it the hand balm is out of this world it is knock out one of the best hand bombs um I've ever used I've never really spent much time with the cleansing products we've had ESOP hand wash and hand lotion before and that's utterly glorious as well and definitely a bit of a treat because it is quite pricey but this geranium Leaf body cleanser sounded amazing so um the really cool thing about ESOP is the detail and the attention to detail when you order online you get a really lots of kind of cute messages and well thought through uh communication I knew this would happen I don't think I've ever bought from ESOP directly before online but look at that the inside of the Box even has this is the flap that came out here so then on the outside of the box there's nothing and the closer you get to the product the more sort of teased you get so you get ease up logo here there's a little description about um the ESOP was established in Melbourne in 1987. we're nearly the same age happy birthday um objective has always been to formulate products with a finance quality blah blah blah blah blah you can read up on that yourself so if you say when you order online that this is a gift they arrive in this really cute uh we're done with that ESOP sort of Hessian bag which I think is quite a nice little touch so particularly nice I did this just for the unboxing it's not a gift I wouldn't normally uh do that but I think that's a really nice touch if you are going to gift it on you can fold this up you know wrap it in tons of tissue paper and stuff so that when they oops when they unwrap the tissue paper and the box that you presented with them yeah you have that which is really nice so inside the little bag we're going to start with the body cleanser because I've never used it before classic iconic styling these uh plastic ESOP brown bottles with this sort of almost uh clinical almost pharmaceutical sort of labeling now this is the geranium Leaf body cleanser which I'm gonna use as a shower gel for a little bit so I really really really love a shower if I've been in the garden all day if I've been traveling I love coming home having a hot shower just feeling fresh again this has geranium Leaf Mandarin rind and Bergamot rind in it so it's going to be an interesting smell aromatic body cleansing gel for all skin types this is the other cool thing about ESOP is most of their products are really good for sensitive skin um most of my body skins okay I have sort of sensitive face a little bit I've got a dry skin but this is a fabulous alternative to regular soap enhanced with geranium leaf extract to cleanse without drying the Skin So ideal actually for the shower usual thing this is sort of a standard pump bottle really I don't think I need to talk about that very much this is a 500 mL bottle um and you know actually you only need a tiny amount with all of the um ESOP um uh products I do so wince a little bit when I watch other people like like pumping and plunging the stuff on it's just a waste a waste of money and a waste of product you really don't need that much I'm just gonna have a quickly look on my computer here to remind me that's right okay so this is 500 mil body wash it's 35 pounds for this bottle by far not the cheapest product you will buy but it's also by far not the most expensive and I have found with ESOP so this is a really nice kind of a slightly jealous consistency which means it's going to go further oh man oh man oh we need to invent smell-o-vision ah that is fresh it is vibrant it's nature oh gosh it is um this is I cannot wait to shower we should do an addition of this where I'm in the shower and you can you can guys can come with me and it's a pass from me I've just realized what I've said that's absolutely not do that that clearly is not going to happen but you can think about it maybe I don't know maybe that doesn't help either um you can be going okay we're not buying it it's a bit leaked out here so it is it's it's green but it's fresh it's it's yellow and orange it's floral it's you can definitely smell a bit of the Bergamot but also the geranium this is absolutely the shower gel you know how there's that shower gel that if you're washing it and it's a little bit oh oh tingly but it's fresh Rosemary is great for for a shower as well in the morning just sort of wakes you up but I don't want something that's like hey wake up we're alive let's go and clean I don't want that I want to kind of hey hey we're ready to start waking up Punchy let's kind of brighten up slowly but here's something fresh and oh here's something that's what I want in the shower right I don't want to be assaulted in a shower that is you know by somebody screaming at me like a military Sergeant to wake up what but this I can't wait to shower on it it's a really really good smell it doesn't smell chemically it doesn't smell um artificial that's a really good natural naturey smell I would uh highly recommend this this is going to be gorgeous I would imagine with like all of the ESOP products it's going to linger as well um it's really sad isn't it it's a bit like herbal tea smells great but somebody recently said to me it's like eating wood it's just like a sucking on a stick it doesn't taste anything like it smells like really nice thing about most of ESOP products is actually it lingers for a bit you know you can sort of smell it on your hand so I'd imagine if you're washing your body in that you're going to feel fresh and alive and a little bit more waking up after it so uh lovely lovely if it's like the rest of it 10 out of 10 I um I highly recommend that so the second part of this unboxing today is for this other product I bought which I've used tons it is my favorite hand cream it's the resurrection aromatic hand balm which comes in this kind of metal tube very much like an oil paint you'd expect to come in this kind of metal tube it's even got the little rolled in there the ESOP products remind me a little bit particularly when they you know the these uh brands of the sort of line of them sorry remind me of uh product packaging that maybe people would have had years ago you know like Matisse and uh Vermeer and people like that that were painting amazing painting Michelangelo you know in something maybe probably not a tool like this this is really commercial that's too late this is more like Dali and uh people like that maybe so it's quite small this is a hundred no it's 75 mil which is why I like it because it fits in my travel bag for traveling and your hands where your skin generally suffers a lot when you're traveling right it dries out and it gets cracked and chipped and then of course if you it dries out you get the kind of cracks in your um your cuticles and they split and that really hurts and your nails aren't in great condition and you know you're touching stuff and handling stuff and moving stuff around when you travel so I often find that with dry hands I just kind of feel um I don't know I type a lot I write a lot with a pen I you know obviously I perform a lot so my hands are quite important to me and I use them a lot in the garden so they do get abused quite a bit so I tried to look after them as it almost as a thank you to my hands for allowing me to be hands and pick stuff up and do stuff now I have been through I mean forever I went through a phase of I mean it went on for years years five six maybe more years buying all sorts any moisturizer I could get my hands on to see literally to see whether it was you know too greasy too milky too watery too smelly not smelly enough not moisturizing enough um this this is knockout this is incredible but it is also quite expensive I like money um I find that all of the ESOP products are quite pricey and it does out price them for some people this is 25 pounds for this 75 mil um I know I know we're all different uh but I think it's worth it this has Mandarin rind just like the other product we just reviewed rosemary leaf and Cedar Atlas I have no idea what Cedar Atlas is but it seems to be the magic ingredient it's like a kind of Woody smell so it is just like a tube of tomato puree in so much that you get a sealed end of that if I do that here you might be able to see it maybe that's irrelevant a camera's going why do we need to see that so it's sealed which is nice so you can sort of double check when you open it on something tampered with the end of the lid has that little kind of you know sharp in it he just literally reverse pop the lid in there you can see that's come out there and then you get this ah it's just so difficult to explain this it is it's a unique smell it's a pleasant smell this is the kind of consistency it is almost a bit like painting actually it's um it's not really runny you can see it kind of it's not running anywhere but it's not super super thick so if I move this around a bit on my palm you'll kind of see the consistency of it right and it's it doesn't feel greasy on your skin there is a can definitely some other Mandarin rind and I think you can smell that cedar Atlas whatever the hell that is I had an outlet at school it was a World Atlas not a sealer at this it's not relevant is it um it's got this it's slightly kind of um creamy almondy kind of uh color to it it's not it's not white uh you can see that and so when you move it in that's just a couple of times right you see how quickly that is I don't have very dry hands today at all but you can see how kind of quickly that gets absorbed and this very very quickly I find this all the time even if my hands aren't dry if I go like a second time round it it um absorbs into your hands really really quickly you see that and that's what I like about it I always do my fingernails as well other cuticles because they dry out really quick um you find that with some hand creams you spend forever rubbing it in or that you know going over it doesn't just doesn't absorb very well I've always found that ESOP hand cream does brilliantly and what's really I mean now they don't feel dry dry but they don't feel slimy and greasy like you can feel it that's in but I would feel comfortable picking anything up right now and there's this I don't know it's quite a it's a mature it's not this is a really difficult thing to say particularly now because I want to offend anybody but it's quite a it's not a feminine smell it's not it's not too flowery it's not too uh that kind of sweet or floral it's it's a woody it's kind of unisexy smell right you know it's not if you want something that smells very pretty this isn't that product if you want something that um will sort of you know slip under the radar or smell sort of a bit sort of I don't know intelligent how does the smell smell intelligent it smells um yeah good it's it's kind of Deep bit Woody but there's a sort of citrus sort of pop in there um and if you you know just kind of wafting your hands around I can't smell it and I really like that because what I don't like is when you sort of put hand cream on and then you can kind of smell it everywhere and it's just like what is that sort of you know they've all got that sort of florally sweetie smell and this is it's a really really it's great 10 out of 10. it's a really really great product really handy size and I like the fact that it's uh natural ingredients too so I'm going to very quickly cover that off because I know from other conversations that I have with people that's really important first ingredients water uh glycerin it doesn't have um it's got sweet almond oil in it it doesn't have any of the nasties in it I'm just double checking this before I absolutely should have put my glasses on for this because it's really tiny as well um oh see Atlas Cedar is Cedar Wood oh there we go bar coil oh from the Cedarwood gotcha um yeah this is lovely orange oil it's all natural lovely stuff carrot lemon oil okay so there's a couple of the sort of the normal things you'd expect to find if you're trying to avoid limonene or linolu um then avoid this but other than that it's all really gorgeous stuff got nut derivatives in it that's the only problem so obviously if you have nut allergies or your um you have concerns about using nuts maybe for other people in your family or colleagues then avoid it so those are my ESOP reviews this week unboxing for the resurrection aromatic hand balm and the geranium Leaf body cleanser both of which I think you should roll around in in utter Joy like a squirrel in a huge bowl of walnuts I'll see you next time foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IizZXDnf3Wo,if you wanted to check this out it is the parsley seed facial cleanser what's open okay Korea virus which he owed me [Music] a team welcome to today's video it is Monday we know what that means it means it's time for another skin care review it has been a bit of a minute since I have done a review and that's because I'm in the lead up to my two and a half week cruise what's open I go coronavirus if you're brand new to my channel my name's Hayden I'm a group exercise instructor I am very big on skin care especially skin care for men I'm obviously a male but as a group exercise instructor I do a lot of sweating as part of my job which means that my pores do tend to get clogged from time to time we all know what clogged pores lead to they lead to very very very unsightly pimples and when you are in my profession and you are on the stage in front of up to 50 60 or 70 people it's not a good look then of course there is the anti aging generally cleansing toning and all of that stuff that comes with skincare today skincare is ESOP ESOP is up there it's not entirely affordable today's product - the blackberry and lactic acid facial gel or facial cleansing gel I should say was $65 this is what it came in it comes in a little bag I wish you could smell it because they put like I think it's aftershave or cologne into the bag and it smells amazing I haven't actually opened it yet Adam got this for me Thank You Adam Adam got this for me out of his own money which he owed me a few days ago now on Thursday I have not used it because I wanted to do it in front of you on the camera so this is what it it's a glass bottle and this is what it looks like as I take it out very sleek very high end it looks medicinal doesn't it looks like a medicine bottle it comes with a pump and the product in a glass bottle like I said before it's $65 and this one is parsley seed facial cleanser it's got licorice root lactic acid black currant seed it's a gentle gel cleanser with a rich lever for use on most skin types it offers additional benefits of mild exfoliation from lactic acid and balancing from jojoba oil the skin will feel completely cleanse clarified and softened apply to dampen skin and massage over face and neck before rinsing alright now what do I actually look for in facial cleansers it's something that's going to give me the results that it has promised to give me in the little synopsis that you find on the bottles I want somewhere isn't overly fragrance that's going to knock me out something that isn't going to leave any kind of residue or going to interact with anything else that I'll put on my face moisturizers etc etc something that just works and is affordable let me just make this statement I know this one $65 and it's not exactly affordable but if you've got the money I actually swear by Aesop this is one this is my favorite skincare line and that's because they are 100% vegan cruelty-free and their products are just amazing generally I haven't tried this one before and the reason I don't use them all the time is because it's $65 shall we just jump straight in I'll just moisten my skin I have just finished doing some cleaning because I am coming up to the cruise I leave Adam and I leave Melbourne on or next week sometime when we get to Sydney the next morning we'll sail out very much looking forward to they are extremely aggressive Royal Caribbean who were sailing with with this whole coronavirus thing they're taking a lot of precautions which I am very much happy for because I don't want to get on board regardless of the coronavirus I don't want to get on board a ship with someone who's going to give me like a cold or a flu and then or the gastro and then I'm stuck in my cabin all day yeah here we go it's very subtle which I'm thankful for sometimes Aesop can get a little bit intense with the fragrance I guess it just depends on the product it is very thick okay my skin is moistened it does say to pump and that's what it looks like a gel it's a very subtle licorice fragrance it's very very thick very thick now I did do a workout this morning so and I have washed or showered because I went and got my hair cut or cut off I needed to get those loose hairs out now this is something that I'm actually really a big fan of when it comes to facial cleansers or facial scrubs when it lathers I know this is probably just in my head but when it lathers I feel like it's activating and doing something this is something that I've done or other products that I've done before where you're putting them onto your face and it doesn't feel like it's doing anything now that it's getting a lot closer to sailing I'm quite excited we just need to get on board that ship alright I have massaged it in and leathered it up it did say you're supposed to do it until the leather starts to break down which it has lets me wipe it off or rinse it off maybe I should just go rinse it I'll be right back and my face is completely washed off it is drying down so it's still got that kind of tacky sticky kind of vibe it does feel very fresh like it cleaned it also claimed that I was going to feel it did also claim that I was going to feel cleansed clarified and softened definitely feel cleansed because that like I said it feels very fresh and I can tell that I've washed my face just hope that this tackiness doesn't stick around because that's a number-one dislike for me like I was saying it started this I don't like it when something has residue because that generally means when you're going to put other things on top such as well the only thing I put on top is moisturizer and sometimes primer if I'm if I'm going on stage and I want my pores to be filled I'll use a clear primer who doesn't want their and wrinkles hidden I mean come on okay now that it's drying down it is completely smooth I don't know if you can actually tell the difference because I do have a ring light on I feel like my skin is very very smooth and definitely clean very clean is this worth sixty five dollars probably can find something a lot cheaper however I am 100% impressed and 100% in love I love Aesop products they always always always seem to hit it home run if you wanted to check this out it is the parsley seed facial cleanser and I will link it down below I don't have any product coats for you and I am NOT sponsored this is just my opinion it does say it's gonna work on different skin types so maybe you should try it out if you've got a different skin type to mine mine's just normal I do tend to get oily in the t-zone sometimes not all the time but if you do try it out make sure you let me know how you go thanks for watching team you know what we're going to do at the end of this smash the like button give me a comment but most importantly stay tuned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRc_4prBkzo,all right guys how many of you know asip the skin care brand from australia that's owned by a brazilian company called natura and co who also owns the body shop and avon do you know this house do you know their fragrances well today i'm going to review four of their fragrances called marrakesh intense tacket or tacit hawaii and rosu their latest fragrance which just launched a few months ago so if you're curious to learn about this house and their fragrances then please stay tuned [Music] thanks so much for tuning in this is sebastian with smelling great fragrance reviews that's right today i'm talking about asip an australian luxury skincare brand and i first discovered this brand way back in probably 2014 when i started going to barneys to buy perfumes well i went to barney's prior to that obviously but i wasn't really digging into skin care until much later but i really enjoyed the the whole you know the idea of the brand their quality and all their scents in their products and the fragrances i recently got into more recently than late and i've got all four of them now as i said it's marrakech intense tacit hawaiial and rozu hawaii would have ended up perfectly on my incense video recently but i didn't have it at the time i just recently picked it up so we're going to find out about these four fragrances but before i get to the fragrances if this is your first time tuning in to my channel and you still haven't subscribed please do click the subscribe button below and also click the bell so you'll be notified for future videos and giveaways so a lot of you have been asking me to cover this brand and finally have all four of their fragrances uh and now it's time for me to cover them and of course you guys have asked me uh about specific fragrances from the the house and not a lot of people talk about the fragrances from this house and i figured you know what it's time that we discuss them there's some great fragrances here and they are um you know there's still mass fragrances but they are a little on the edgy side they're not like you know your typical department store fragrances where everybody or every fragrance smells similar there's some unique things here they're more indeed to me they they act a little more indie-esque uh indie-esque niche like indie houses so their fragrances seem to seem like that in comparison to uh their other brands the body shop which are very mass i believe uh from what i've sampled in the past so this is different definitely and i'm not too experienced with avon so it's been a long time since i've smelled anything avon but this brand i think it totally stands out next to the body shop and the body shop is a skincare brand as well so let's go ahead and talk about marrakesh intense first i want to show you how the fragrances come now these are a little uh i ordered a mail order uh and a little they're a little scuffed up they come in little boxes like this and each fragrance has a different price all four fragrances three of them are eau de parfum concentration the very first one i'm going to talk to you about is marrakech intense it's eau de toilette concentration and as i said all four have different prices this marrakesh intense is the least expensive it's 50 ml and it's 95 dollars auto toilet as i said and this fragrance to me is more woodsy spicy with slightly floral nuances and it's inspired by something you would smell in the spice markets of marrakech that's why it's called marrakech intense but i was also doing some research and i said i noticed that on their website asip's website it said that they're inspired by culinary adventures of the spice markets so you know this is actually really uh spicy but also it's uh i was thinking i would name drop like something like tower perfumes layer to desert maro cane they're not at all similar except for the fact that this is spicy just like that what i like about this one that uh the cardamom stands out a lot but everything in here connected together has a very fizzy almost like coca-cola kind of a vibe which actually is fun uh soda fragrances are fun and there is something in the background that acts like it's bubbling uh like a can of coke that you've poured into a cup and it's fizzing everywhere i like that part of uh this fragrance is it really reminding me of the spice markets in market well i've never been to marrakech i've always wanted to go but i can smell the spices in here and i think what's causing that um fizzy quality is the cloves with the bergamot at the top notes which is really really wonderful i really love it so if you like spicy fragrances i recommend this this that's how the bottle is right here and the packaging for uh asip's marrakech intense again there are smaller bottles they're easy to transport they're a little heavy uh the glass i feel like is definitely a really strong glass so if it falls it might not break but don't take my word on that one but marrakesh intense is fun it's a fun fragrance and i like that whole coca-cola fizziness inside you can see some very interesting writing but recently i picked up hawaii this is it right here from a local san francisco shop aesop shop and they're not cellophane wrapped so i think that's how the fragrances are handed and i ordered the other three that i'm talking about including marrakesh intense so marrakesh intense tacit and rozu were mail ordered uh they came like this that's quite a little they're a little scuffed because the shipping kind of ruined them because they're not cellophane wrapped so this one's the 95 one the least expensive one and also the eau de toilette one the rest of them are eau de parfum so if you like spicy fragrances they're a little on the playful side because of this whole fizzy vibe that i get from marrakech intense you should check out this one um i like it it's a great fragrance actually um they're not overly strong the fragrances are more subtle they're not like loud beasts or anything like that so i think the best way to experience these fragrances is to get some samples if you can or go to an asip store and sample there as i said here we had barney's it's no longer here but in san francisco i think there's two or three ace of skin care stores that i can go to and you know sample their skin care products or body products and then of course smell their fragrances and there's a total of four so the second fragrance i'm going to talk to you about today is tacit which is here so this is slightly higher priced it's 125 for a 50 ml but it's also an eau de parfum concentration fragrance and again it's not cellophane wrapped and this is what the inside looks like and the bottle is similar brownish color but seems a little on the greener side in comparison to marrakesh intense i should not have put although they're the same color as you can see so tacit some so i noticed that on their website it says this is a uh modern take on a classic cologne so it uses a lot of citruses it's green it's bitter it's citrusy it's fresh woody and spicy so those are all uh key words or accords i guess i should say that come to mind with this one but at the top there's loads of citruses and yuzu yuzu fruit and yuzu is like grapefruit so there's this bitterness about it there's a zinginess about it but it's also um causing a little bit of subduedness i i find that a lot of the fragrances in this collection they're not screamers so if you don't like screamers then these probably are ones that you would like if you do like screamers these might not be ones that you should try there anytime i experience fragrances that are a little subdued a little more quiet there's some classiness around them uh there's some i don't want to use the word sophisticated but whenever fragrance screams like loud beasts things like that i would never call those fragrances classy because they're just overwhelmingly strong and um you know class goes with the subtleties for me and i just think that anytime that fragrances have the subtleness about it then i can you know call it a classy fragrance and this one definitely has it um one thing i forgot to mention all their fragrances are unisex gender neutral it says on their website and once again this one also has um cloves and i've noticed that their fragrances all three except for marrakesh intense has vetiver so the vetiver deodorant obviously uh from this house is something that i really enjoy it is pricey it's really dark earthy and smoky and i feel like they complement the three fragrances and i think they should also complement marrakesh intense as well because i think it would work it would just add a smoky layer to that fragrance which i think might be missing because seems very bright for marrakesh intense for spices and things like that definitely i think it needs a little uh smokiness but going back to tacit um if you like the bitterness of colognes if you like them spicy woody of uh like traditional odor colognes or uh fragrances that are inspired by you know citrusy odor colognes this might be one for you to try the clothes there's clothes again in here and there's clothes in the other fragrance as well so it seems like some notes they do like to use over and over again now i wasn't able to find the details of who the perfumers are on these fragrances so i don't really know but i'm actually digging a lot of these fragrances if i want some less i guess if i want some subtle more subtle fragrances i would go with the fragrances from this but yeah i can see the whole um citrus uh oda cologne or cologne inspired qualities of this fragrance but it does have a little more of a dense oomph woodsyness and spiciness about it so that's tacit with an interesting name um their names are pretty interesting here tacit and uh hawaii uh which is the next fragrance we're gonna talk about are pretty interesting rozu kind of gives me a hint of what i'm going to smell rose rosu and marrakech spa intense i i think is a fairly straightforward name so that's tacit once again this is a 50 ml 125 not the most expensive the last fragrance is the most expensive and we're going up in price every time we do a fragrance in this collection so the cheapest is the marrakesh intense so this is the newest fragrance i just recently picked it up from one of our asap locations here in san francisco and this is called hawaii h-w-y-l i don't know this name i didn't do research on the name pretty interesting name almost reminds me of highway or hawaii hawaii or whatever it doesn't matter uh i don't know how it also matches the the fragrance because it's a smoky woody japanese forest incense inspired fragrance and that's why i said this would have been perfect in my instance fragrances video but it also reminds me of con de garcons uh inspired in scentsy kind of woodsy fragrances so hawaii is a 2017 launch i didn't say the dates on the other fragrances today marrakesh intense was 2014 um tacit was 2015 in hawaii is 2017. odapar femme 50ml 135. so this one actually has lots of greenish touches inside the box here i like it it's almost like green lilies or something i don't know what that image has anything to do with the fragrance but once again the same color similar color bottle as you can see if i can get all three up here but yeah they're the same color although this one seems a little yellower so hawaii is a smoky woody rich green dark forest incense and totally reminds totally reminds me of incense fragrances or woodsy incense-y fragrances or smoky fragrances from the com de garcon so i can see that this might be inspired by those fragrances but then again i don't know um it's definitely green and it's a kind of incense japanese incense to me like kyoto from the garcon cdg incense series there is something more balanced about it it's not like ultra smoky and also burned it smells a little more green and woodsy and this actually captures that very well with this one at the top you've got lots of spices like thyme and other spices well thyme is an herb obviously but other spices so there's a spicy start aromatic herbal start and then the cypress comes in now i don't know if it's a cypress like traditional western cypress or if it's like hanoki which is a japanese cypress i believe and then there's also more woods and then in the base notes is the olive and that gives it the smoky incense-y touch with vetiver oak moss there's a vetiver again and i like this one a lot it's definitely easy to wear incense because it's not all about the incense there's the spices the aromatic touches and then also the wood so all of it is nicely blended together and for a dark smoky incensie ex woody experience definitely the green comes into mind too uh it has lots of green touches so that's hawaii let me know if you guys are fans of this because this one seems to get a lot of um i mean what i'm about to say is like people comment and mention this particular fragrance that they're fans of so i can see that it's pretty popular maybe it's the most popular from the collection that's why i wasn't able to buy all four of them together i had to buy this one locally from our uh asap store here in san francisco anyway a while 135 for a 50 ml launched in 2017 and the last fragrance here the one i experienced the most because i've been wearing this for the longest because i really love it is rosu so 20 20 launch 50ml 180. now this one's really really expensive not sure what happened with this one maybe it's the notes they're using so row zoo you can kind of tell from the color it's a rosy pinkish purplish red as far as the box goes it seems like there's woods on it and green leaves but obviously it's in black and white so with this particular fragrance for me it hints at a little bit of a little bit le labo's uh rose 31 so it's a kind of a spicy rose earthy bitter green definitely lots of spices and lots of green stems you can kind of smell the stems the rose stems when you chop them or cut them to put in a voss there's a smell you definitely pick it up here but it does have oh i think it does have a little bit of cumin and that's kind of why it reminds me a little bit of rose 31. they're not identical though don't worry but i think what's giving me that kind of green stemmy uh smell is the shiso there's shiso in the notes but this one again it's floral it's green woody and spicy and there's some light smoky touches in here as well top notes are rosebud bitter orange bergamot shiso and pink pepper and i think that originally that when you first spray it you get that kind of green stemmy quality that rose stems have rose ylang yulong jasmine and gayak wood in the heart and i think the gayak wood must be this right there finally in the base notes there are some smoky resonance touches in the musk patchouli myrrh sandalwood and vetiver vetiver comes again and i think rose 31 also has vetiver but for me rose 31 is not so stemi i don't have that shiso uh a kind of greenish slightly stemmy a green stemmy kind of a smell definitely not present in rose 31 it is here but i think the there's a coumany undertone in here it doesn't mention cumin but something maybe is causing that kumini kind of smell that you know some kind of an accord but the vetiver definitely is prominent here that's also in rose 31 and of course the roses in here but this is really really great it's quite sexy because of the kumini touches i quite like it and again it's not like a full jammy rose it's just a dry kind of um it's just almost like a like the life span of a rose because it's you go when you first smell a rose it doesn't have a lot of smell you smell the greenness when it hasn't opened up and then as it's developing it's getting sweeter and sweeter and more you know jammy and things like that so you have the whole entire experience here with this fragrance and that's what i like about it it's kind of like a rose journey but it's not a full-on in your face rose but great scent the most expensive unfortunately 180 for a 50 ml eau de parfum and 2020 launch so this is rozu from the house of asip so those are the four fragrances from asap i wanted to do this video as you guys have been asking me and finally it's done and let me know what your thoughts are on this house do you use their skin care i mean have you tried any of their skin care because i've tried some and they're pretty interesting i don't really uh i guess i should say i'm not really like a skin care person i don't do a lot i should to make me look younger maybe but as far as the fragrances are concerned these are great but of course their deodorant the vetiver deodorant is awesome you should check it out and some of their products i have used here and there and i think they're also great so i should definitely look into using them but anyway those are my thoughts on the four fragrances from asip marrakesh intense tacit or is it tackett hawaii and rozu if you're fans of these fragrances or that house for their skincare or body care please let me know put some comments down also which one sounds great to you if you've never tried them because i'd like to find out after hearing me talk about the fragrances which one would you check out first anyway guys thanks so much for watching today if you have any questions or comments please list below otherwise please like this video please share it follow me on facebook twitter and instagram and i'll be back with more videos very soon have a good one goodbye [Music] you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlYootxKD2k,is the primrose facial hydrating cream it's right over here it has lavender it has rosemary and there's one more product sage leaf which is awesome if you're spiritual like me it is great sage is great for warding off of like evil spirits and energies so i don't know i just love that that kind of aspect when there's some alchemy um involved in it and then it's also you know it's also just very very hydrating it's also very very i mean this containers are so cute too you know the the um old school the old school uh containers which are just like made of this brown glass are just so beautiful um it's which is why i love ace up as well because they make great shelfies if you ever you know take photos of products on your shelves like myself so and then also like on the labels everything is on there for your concern um and this is a great hydrating cream i can use it during the winter or the summer or the spring if you're going to be using it on the summer you know like myself instead of using half a teaspoon i would recommend using um half probably like a pea sized amount because it's a little bit goes a long way which is nice um i'll open it up for you so you can see the cream here it's it's viscosity is pretty thick which is nice my skin tends to be very dry and combination skins sometimes oily sometimes a knot but i prefer to be on the moisturized side because who wants to look dry and dusty no one does so if you see this here it's just a little bit just rubbing it on and it's again a little bit goes a long way so i maybe put a little bit too much but i just love that it immediately makes my skin super plumped um so you see that there's even a like a little glow finish which is nice it easily absorbs and it keeps you hydrated again people i mean another tip of mine is like don't forget to put it underneath your neck and your decollete which is just in this area because skincare and facial hair are i mean it's just it's not just your face it's your entire body so don't forget to moisturize the other parts of your body um from like your shoulders to decolletes and then also you know even the back of your neck because you know you got to stay hydrated so again that's the primrose facial hydrating cream oh another thing that i love to do with this cream is you can use it as a deep like a deep hydrating mask so after a night or a couple weeks out of this if you're in the sun or a couple days or hours in the sun what i like to do is actually just layer it and layer that on kind of thick and just leave it on for like five minutes ten minutes and then just like wash it off or even like pat it down with like a a round cloth or a cotton round to just make sure that you get the excess moisture the excess cream um but then my skin always feels super baby soft so again you can already see like on the side of my face it's still glowy it's still nourished it's hydrated which is what we love especially if you're priming your skin for um makeup foundation and all that or even just wearing your skin your face bare-faced so we definitely love the primrose facial hydrating cream i highly highly recommend it and again you need a reminder of the deals that are currently going on we have 15 off beauty and 25 off of all fashion which is great and if you check out during this live and even 30 minutes after you'll get an additional 15 off so it's a great deal highly recommend it next we have the asap fabulous facial oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8rKrk-Rgc8,we going to do right now we're going to go straight into mines in to mind facial toner from esap here it is here it is our beautiful beautiful Amber bottle that means we're working with Isa this is a toner did not believe in toner before but I have been using this and just makes my skin feel so great um it sootheses the pores I'm gonna go ahead and apply it and explain it uh soothing the porous or my pants I'm gonna do it with the pants this time which if my skin is clean from the makeup I just apply it on my um just on my hands and just pat pat tap tap tap I'm gonna remove whatever makeup is left so I'm gonna use the little uh pad and you can do both you can do both whichever is good for you so um I'm gonna apply a little it also gives like a little uh tingle with all the active ingredients so I'm gonna remove the rest on my cinnamide that is inside is going to make sure I'm not going to have any any pimples any blemishes prevents acne as well into mines a line from esap and as well working for combination skin so toner if you have combination skin which means if parts of your skin parts of your face or oily parts are dry you want to you know re-establish the pH of your skin which is very important and make sure that you know some parts of your skin are not over producing oils which they are if you have oily skin and just in general to balance the skin tone to balance the skin pH use the toner in the first place remember when the toners were used for just to remove the makeup now they are you can also use it but here we are did I did I was I lost for a second sorry uh We're Going On To The Next Step love this so much Britney love this so much myself personally that's why I'm here uh telling selling and talking about it answering all your questions anytime as much as I know I'm gonna answer and uh can I just tell you this because I've been doing it so consistently just in general the skincare routine the skin is really just improved it's so smooth like I can't you obviously can't feel it but you know when you have like underline bumps or anything or whatever it's just too dry or too oily it's so smooth I can't even not I can't even explain I'm waking up I'm like wow like and you know before I go to bed I'm like wow it's like it's still there right it didn't disappear it really it really is working you know all the steps so I mean I have been doing my skincare routine for forever but this is like really really really working if you are consistent with what you're consistent with what you do disco face mask it was so funny because I have used it in the morning because I woke up I'm so like puffy I'm like I need to get ready for the podcast I'm like where's my mask and then I have decided to include it in the routine and then very shop is posting uh not knowing obviously I was using it in the morning um me with the Disco mask I'm like we have just tuned in one field of information today and thought about it what time of day would you use this if you mean mask anytime to be honest because if when you have time anytime because you're going to wash it away if you men toner in the morning before go to bed so twice uh if you have one time do it one time I do it in the morning to you know get my skin into like ready for the world first of all the face looks nice second of all the skin is protected for the future damage of the outside world pollution and UVA UVB light and we have to be protected from the Sun for sure and just three radicals and you know why do we use antioxidants because our skin is being constantly exposed to O2 which is oxygen but it how funny it sounds it's still you know makes our skin sort of Damages is because um of oxidation so funny enough but we need to protect ourselves when we go outside and you might not see you know on everyday basis but over time uh if you're using a product for your skin I'm going to go ahead and apply because I'm talking like too much um if you are protecting your skin the skin is going to be so thankful and you're going to see the Improvement if you've been using sunscreen for example um for before you know starting your day you're gonna see that over time your skin has less wrinkles more elastic because the collagen simply cannot be destroyed by UVA light what do we have right now we have disco mask which includes charcoal and many more active ingredients leave it for 15-20 minutes rinse or after when it dries what it does it's like observes everything from your pores maybe not everything but a lot of things charcoal is sort of like a glue the molecules of active charcoal is gluing all the dirt and oils you know to on them on on them and then you just wash it away so when you wait for it to dry then you're gonna see what has you know happened to your pores because you're going to see all the like black dots are sort of like super black on your nose because you like oh my god what happened like there there was soaked out uh sucked out uh this is a skincare from men disco again this is very unisex but uh if you are a man and you need a skincare routine or you need a skincare routine Just For Men this is the brand to go with uh super unisex Max mask but um again they have everything from in their line is from in and uh um lovely just lovely there is um so many products for you uh to go with disco I prefer this mask because and I usually I applied it you know for my whole face before I just did it for you to see then this is how it's gonna dry up see this is drying up so they say leave it for 15-20 minutes and it really is going to do the job reduce the puffiness uh you know suck all the dirt out and um yeah just detox your whole face uh I love doing masks once a week oh I'm so sorry of course I can thank you for asking I am so sorry here we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lfgPGR2Svg&ab_channel=Dr.MichelleDaf,[Music] so today I'm here to do a first impression on some products and that kicked up from ESOP now if you're new to my channel then you don't know that I love ESOP skincare it is one of my favorite skincare lines and their formulations just work very well for me so I ended up breaking out really bad this past month I don't know what product did it because I used so many new skincare and makeup products within like a two week time span that I freaked out my skin and when I tell you the breakouts were bad they would breakouts that I've never even had before in places I've never had them and for whatever reason I was just having a really hard time narrowing down what the problem was so one that usually happens what most people do they go back to what they know and so I went back to II stop my experience with ESOP products have been so positive the only reason why I stopped using I'm the products once I finished them was one because I just wanted to try something different and two because some of the products stopped working as well for me and I don't know if it's just because I was using it so much that my skin was like switch it up Michelle so maybe the results weren't the same but either way I wanted to go back to that so when I went on the website I realized that they had a brand new line I've never seen and when I clicked on it I was so excited to see that it's actually formulated for people with oily combination skin which is what I have and with my skin I get very oily on my t-zone and then the rest of my face is normal but when you have this skin type you are more prone to breakouts especially me because my pores are pretty big so I was excited this new line is called in two minds I'm gonna go ahead and read what the website says combination skin is generally characterized by an oily ER or head or nose with dry to very dry skin across the cheeks with a greater propensity to reactivity two lines is formulated to address these complexities by gently cleansing normalizing sebum production soothing irritation and providing lightweight hydration without overburdening this game the cleanser that I got is the into mind facial cleanser I got the 100 milliliter and that cost $33 and the 200 milliliter cost 50 so it's actually cheaper to get the bigger one but I wanted to test it out it's a mild gel cleanser contains salicylic acid into mine's facial cleanser is exceptionally gentle and effective in decongestant the skin without stripping moisture so we can first just get into the packaging if you guys have never seen any of my other ESOP reviews I'm gonna go ahead and link them below because I probably reviewed about 20 of their products in the past because I love this line so go ahead and check those out but one thing that I love about ESOP and I always talk about it because it's what really drew me to the brand is their packaging I love the medicine bottle kind of look the one gripe I have about this product off top it's just the fact that it does not come with the pump the cleansers don't you have to actually ask for them when you're in the store but I do wish that the brand would have an option online for you to click because it's free so it's very annoying to have the product without having a pump because you're literally pouring a cleanser onto your hand so that I don't like they have to find a better way to do that so now getting into the cleanser it says that it contains witch hazel salicylic acid which is really good for any kind of like acne or pimples it also contains sage these smell I can definitely smell the sage so it is kind of earthy but it does have a kind of like spicy medicine scent to it as well I like the ESOP smells I think aromatherapy is so nice and I love my skincare products to have that aromatic feeling as I'm using it this is that it just decongest as a skin without aggravating or stripping it now I'm only used at one time and I was very impressed but I was a little bit thrown off too and that's because the cleanser although it's thick when it goes on to the actual skin it doesn't lather that much and I'm used to having a lot of lather and foam in my cleanser because I usually go in with my brush and with this this is what it looks like when I used my cleansing brush over my skin with it [Music] so I may just go ahead and use it as a follow-up cleanser after using like a cleansing balm first I'm not quite sure I'm gonna have to play around with that but so far so good after I used it and I quashed my skin off my skin felt very clear and clean but it was also hydrated it didn't feel stripped at all and I was really impressed I just wish that it lathered up a little bit more so if you're not subscribed to my channel already make sure that you do that so that way you'll be able to catch a review on how I feel about it once I'm done using it so once you're done cleansing your skin you're supposed to use a toner to make sure that you got rid of any excess oil inter or makeup on your face and I was actually really shocked that they sent me a sample size of their toner now I'm gonna come in ESOP on this because that's actually how I got to just fall in love with the brand the first time that I ever visited the store in Santa Monica they gave me sample sizes of different things and I used it I loved it and went back and I repurchased so it's important for brands to do that but what I love about them and some of the other high-end skincare brands is that they sent you a good enough sample to be able to use it more than one two or three times this is a point fluid ounce bottle and you only need a couple drops on the cotton pad and that's it I thought that was really neat because this is a very generous sample into mine's facial toner is a refreshing formulation to be used after cleansing it is effective and lifting excess sebum and preparing the skin for hydration the 100 milliliter is $35 for me toner is one of those products that I actually really like but I have a hard time usually finding a good toner I was very impressed with my first time using this toner it definitely did a great job of taking away all the dirt and oil on my face I noticed a difference after using a toner my face just felt very supple and like it says it contains me a side of meat which is so good for your skin for aging is also wonderful for helping the appearance of your pores if you have really big pores like me help you to just make them a lot less visible and clearing up your skin tone so that it's even and plump and so this this toner I know I'm gonna get I was really impressed so once again these generous samples really do bring in sales once you're done with the toner they have a lotion or as they call a hydrator what I've noticed from ESOP is they either have serums as like your lotion and then they have hydrators which are lotion but it's usually on the thicker side and then they have creams that are in the tubs so this is the hydrator so you can just consider it as a lotion and they also sent me a sample size of this which was a very generous amount as well and I was very appreciative it says that the into minds of facial hydrator hydrates with Andrea bus seat copaiba seed and acai into - facial hydrator combines a potent blend of botanical ingredients to soothe purify and nourishes skins post cleansing lightweight non-greasy and rapidly absorbs on application it offers hydration without overburdening the skin this 60 milliliter bottle retails for $60 so it is quite pricey now I'm gonna say off of first impressions with using this I was blown away you guys it is so rare that I'm able to find a moisturizer that actually moisturizes and then just disappears and that's what happened when I use this upon application it did seem like it was sick but you only need very very very little and it spreads really nice and evenly and then just immediately sinks into your skin leaving your face super soft but it still feels like it's been moisturized and it's the coolest thing I have it on today and when I put my primer over this lotion superb my complexion looks so clear today and I've had my makeup for the last six hours and it didn't make me greasy at all like it really really cut down on my oil production I am really impressed with everything I've used so far but that baby I see myself purchasing it like I really cannot imagine my summer without it because the summer time is a real test as oily girls we know that summertime is the best time to know whether or not these things really work so I am very very pleasantly surprised with the into Minds line after my whole breakouts girls planning to come back to ESOP to pick up more of the parsley seed line but I'm so happy that I found this if you guys have used it let me know I wanted to show you guys another product that I picked up from Esau and it's the tea tree leaf facial exfoliant and it has aloe vera walnuts and tea tree leaf crushed into it and it's designed to gently exfoliate your skin this is a very tiny bottle it's a 1.1 ounce now this is supposed to be a exfoliant that you're supposed to mix into your cleanser and it has tea tree in it which is wonderful for when you have a breakout and that's why I purchased it because I told you my skin was going nuts so I purchased it solely to use when I have a breakout or my skin just needs to be decongestant which is a once a week thing for me so this product is so finely milled so sand like that it's not going to be abrasive at all against the skin I moved away from using the exfoliant that have like the grains in them that you're scrubbing into your face because for me that's caused irritation I've now moved over to exfoliating via masks that have like acids in them or clay masks so this is what my face look like afterwards and you're gonna have to come back to see what my final thoughts are gonna be about this product and the last thing that I wanted to touch upon was in my last ESOP video I think I was sharing about 13 products in that video I talked about the aromatic hand wash the resurrection hand wash remember the name of it but the big hand wash they shared in that video I said at the time that it was just okay it wasn't really all that I haven't really noticed much of a difference in anything it's just soap let me tell you I've never been so wrong that soap is superb and I didn't really notice it and I don't know why I'm not sure why it wasn't catching my attention I was so caught up on the smell and I wasn't really paying attention to how my hands were feeling afterwards once it ran out and I went back to what I was using I was I was in shock at how my hands looked physically looked different that soap is awesome like that's going to be a life staple product it is so moisturizing ah I mean okay I'm not gonna continue talking about you stop cuz you guys know I can talk about ESOP all day thank you so much for watching this video on my first impressions I hope it was helpful if you were looking at this brand or if you're wondering what this line was all about and how it works I hope you were able to take something away from this video please let me know if you have any questions and if you don't big kisses to you all through month thank you guys so much for being a part of my YouTube family and I will see you guys in the next video [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YERnVA7DU8,hi there today we're going to be decoding the ingredients in asop's seeking silence hydrator now the manufacturer says this product is very good for sensitive skin it reduces some irrita redness and calms irritated skin and in the marketing uh promotional material they specifically mentioned a few ingredients like um bisibolol and selena extract and there are a few other zeita bulb extracts but i won't be talking about these ingredients because these are not in the top seven in here at skincabin.com we only decode the first seven ingredients of the product so let's get started so the first ingredient in this product is water water as such does not have a functional role but what it does for the skin but what it does it actually brings all the other ingredients in the product together uh so if it's not going to be bringing all the ingredients together all the ingredients will be by itself and that won't be good for the product so water does play an important role it brings all the ingredients in the product together it also enhances the texture of the product number two ingredient is glycerin glycerin is a humectant a humectant is a water magnet what humectants do is they attract water from the atmosphere and bring it to the top layer of skin so they keep the skin hydrated and glycerin is a very effective humectant you will see a lot of skin care products they will you they will um they will use some glycerin as their humectant um so basically it attracts water from the atmosphere and brings it to the top layer of the skin and thus keeps the skin hydrated it's a water magnet the third product is choline now scolin a form of scolin it's actually found in the sebum of naturally found in the sebum on our skin now sebum is the oil on the skin when you touch the skin when you feel that oiliness in the skin that's the sebum now sebum plays an important role in the skin barrier function what i mean by that is the top layer of the skin acts as a barrier it acts as a shield it has two important functions number one to prevent water from the deeper layers of skin from evaporating into the environment and number two prevent attacks from the environmental nasties and uh aggressors by it protects the skin it's the first layer of the defense first layer of defense and it protects the skin from all these attacks and if you didn't do that what will happen is the skin will get constantly attacked by all these irritants and there'll be loads of breakouts on the skin and if it doesn't prevent water from the deeper layers of the skin from it evaporating then the skin will become dehydrated dehydrated so uh um so the skin's barrier function has a very important role in keeping the skin hydrated and protecting it from irritants and thus preventing lots of breakouts in the skin now sebum there are many things which will help the skin it's in its barrier function one of them is sebum and sebum has an ingredient in it naturally present in it called scholine so this particular product also has choline so when you apply this particular product i guess the skin will recognize as choline as one of its own and it gets easily absorbed into the skin so that's a good thing so it enhances the barrier function it helps the skin in the barrier function it goes and adds to that um scaling that's already there so it's got a good role to play the next thing is coco capriate um that is an emollient it is derived from uh usually derived from coconut oil now it's an emollient meaning it when you an emollient when you apply it to the skin uh for as long as it stays on the skin it'll keep the skin soft it'll go fill up all the gaps in the skin and it'll keep the skin soft for as long as it's on the skin this particular ingredient is also an emulsifier an emulsifier it brings all the unlike ingredients in the product together so and product will have different kinds of ingredients some of these ingredients don't mix easily an emulsifier does the job of bringing them all together and the next ingredient is tri benin peg 20 esters try benin peg 20 esters now this one is also an emollient so it as long as it stays in the skin it'll keep the skin soft and it also is an emulsifier so it brings all the unlike ingredients together so that's that those are the two functions the next one is jojoba seed oil now jojoba seed oil uh it's very rich in wax esters now wax esters are also something the vaccistus also play a very important role in skin's barrier function it's also naturally present some of these ancestors that's there in jojoba oil is also naturally present in our skin and so when you apply this jojoba oil on our skin our skin will recognize some of the back sisters as well as some of its own and it will easily absorb those back sisters now because it plays an important role in barrier function it strung strengthens the barrier and in strong barrier means less breakouts and less water loss less breakouts and less water loss means how do we have that when we have a strong barrier and the final ingredient is jojoba estus and jojoba esters that's also made from jojoba oil what jojoba esters do is they slightly exfoliate the skin that means a slightly removed they have a slight exfoliation property in that they remove the dead cells slightly from the top layer and thus brighten the skin so that's about it those are the top seven ingredients the glycerin is important one it keeps the skin hydrated then you have scholine and you have got jojoba seed oil now these two have uh ingredients in them which the skin recognizes as its own and can probably absorb easily and these two also help the skin in its barrier function a strong barrier means less breakouts and a hydrated skin so these are three important ingredients glycerin scoling and the jojoba oil and then you've got a couple of emollients in there as i mentioned at the start of the video we are only decoding the top seven ingredients we only decode seven ingredients the top seven in skin cabin.com because we think that's where the concentration is high and the maximum effect on the skin is coming from these top seven ingredients so as the manufacturer says yes it's probably uh absorbed easily by the skin because it's got um the scrolling and the jehovah oil and um um and yeah because it's got scrolling and jojoba oil it's a facial hydrator i the hydration part is coming from the glycerin a lot of manufacturers would have a glycerin in them so the manufacturer says it's very good for um all types of skin but especially sensitive skin and it acts to soothe calm and quite the discomforting skin and reduces the redness so um i think it's a squalene um it would be the scolie and the jojoba oil which is helping to strengthen the skin barrier which is helping a strong barrier means less breakouts so that's where this um that's where the claim of it reducing the irritation on the skin comes and the hydration part comes from glycerin and um yes that's about it so um that's the decoding of the ingredients so it's um up to you so the way to buy a skincare product is you look at the ingredients and see this ingredient does that okay this ingredient glycerin yes a lot of skincare products will have skin glycerin and then you've got jojoba oil yeah and then you've got this choline now compare it with another in product and see if they would also have something similar and where is it placed in the ingredient list the higher up the more the concentration and see the mixture of other ingredients i hope you found this video helpful if you did please give it give us a thumbs up and do subscribe to our channel i'll see you in the next video bye for now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxumeziuM1k&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,[Music] hey beautiful people haha hope you guys doing wonderful beauty to my channel welcome my name is Michelle and if you're one of my subscribers welcome back so I'm here today to share with you some products from the brand called ESOP I've talked about this brand over and over again because I stumbled across the store and I fell in love Etha is an Australian brand and they make skin care products hair care products products for your household and I would consider it to be luxury skincare the reason why I love ESOP products is because I'm really into sensory skin care I love my skin care items to have a pleasant aroma to give me an aromatherapy kind of feeling while using it my skincare ritual is really luxurious very relaxing it's my time to kind of pamper myself at the beginning and at the end of my day so I do tend to gravitate towards products that are mostly natural have a really nice aroma and perform well for my skin so ESOP does all of those things and today I have 13 products to share with you guys but if there's something that I don't touch upon feel free to leave a comment below so let's get started this first product I have is called the resurrection aromatic hand wash and it has mandarin lined rosemary leaf and cedar atlas inside of it this is a hand soap and I have it in 16.9 food ounces when I first visited the ESOP store in Santa Monica California they told me that this was one of their best-selling products and when I saw people walking in the store they kept picking this up I did not pick it up at first because I truly could not see myself spending that kind of money on hand pills but as I fell in love with the brand I truly do believe that their products are high performing and honestly they are just so aesthetically pleasing in my bathroom the way the soap sits next to the mouthwash and I'll talk about everything just kind of comes together the silk works well it works like soap I'm not really that big on hand so I could go buy something from Bath and Body Works and I'm good with that so to me it works well it smells good but it's just passable tow in my opinion I didn't see anything that was super special about this product other than the fact that it smells really nice and it looks really good the next test I have is the ESOP mouthwash and it has close and nice and spearmint leaf in it this is a regular mouthwash to help you clear any kind of bad breath or anything going on with your mouth I love this mouthwash first of all look at how beautiful it is you see like just the jar the start is glad but I do think they sell some that are just like in a regular bottle I love this top this little beaker top it so freaking cute you just pour the mouthwash in you drink it and your mouth is super happy and it's super happy because this mouthwash does not burn your mouth at all it's really smooth and a lot of people have tried this mouthwash out when they came to visit me and they've always made a comment about it afterwards saying that it was kind of weird the reason that they felt like it was weird was because it doesn't have that like really sinking feeling that Listerine gives you it feels like it very much could just be even water but it has that really nice spearmint taste at the end and it does do the job as far as like clearing your bad breath but if you're into like that stinging feeling that Listerine gives you you're not going to get that with it I really like it I've purchased it twice I do think it's really expensive from not blush but once you use this mouthwash you're not going to feel comfortable using anything else if you do go in the store to purchase it make sure that you asked for the little top because they don't just give it to you you have to actually ask for it and the last home product that I have are de stop post who dropped it has tangerine peel ylang-ylang mandarin peel in it and it smells amazing when I first saw this product I was like um I don't know about this but someone in the store told me that she gave it out to people as housewarming gifts and everyone loved it and what they are are drops just a freshen up of the bathroom it has a dropper on it and how I use it is I just put a couple drops in the toilet and a couple drops in the sink whenever I feel like it the whole bathroom smells so good it's amazing how concentrated it is because just a couple drops gives the bathroom this really early sweet aromatic scent it smells wonderful this is something that I will continue to repurchase it's not extremely long-lasting but it does linger for about an hour or so and if you're really into kind of like the sensory experience when you're doing your skincare regimen you could even put a couple of drops in the sink before you wash your face in the morning and you can just kind of breathe and take in the aroma while you're washing your face I promise you can fall in love this next product is the resurrection aromatic candle and this is just a hand balm it's a hand cream I've heard so much about the ESOP hand creams it seems like most people who are introduced to Esau it's kind of like their go-to product is their hand ball so I really did have high expectations for it I plan to use it as a hand lotion and as a foot lotion and I love the way this smells oh my goodness it smells so good the cream is yellow it's like a really thick yellow cream the consistency of it is pretty thick I love it as a hand lotion I think it works really well it's very creamy very moisturizing and it smells so good guys oh my goodness I love the way this smells it has the same smells of soap because they're both the resurrection so you can buy them together but whatever you purchase it know for the price point I can find much more reasonable hand balms to do the job I wanted to also use it I guess an all-over body lotion because of the way it smells but honestly it's just too expensive for that it's only 2.6 ounces so there's not that much in it and I feel like with my body I could probably finish it up in two to three uses but as a hand cream and a foot cream it's very very good after you use it on your hands your hands don't feel greasy or sticky it does moisturize so it does sink into your skin but like I said there's no like greasy residue the next part I have is the parsley seed facial cleansing oil and this has macadamia seeds to suffer all beta-carotene in it and it's a mild facial cleanser but suited for dry combination and sensitive skin I will be doing a skincare video where I show you all my skin care products and I'm also going to do a video that specifically looks at oil cleansers and this is an oil cleanser one thing I just want to point out that I love about Usopp is that just love the packaging you guys the glass on it is so nice I love the darkness of the bottles it kind of looks like a medicine bottle people make comments about that looks kind of like old-school medicine I think it's beautiful it fits the aesthetic of my home I just love the fact that I can sit it out and it looks like it could be decor I think that's just oh I love that so back to the product this is a oil cleanser it's very very thick this was my go-to cleanser in the winter time because of how moisturizing it is in the morning when I wake up I don't like my skin to feel like it's stripped because I have a whole nighttime regimen for my skin in the morning my skin looks really supple it looks really fresh and I don't like to just take away all of that so I do like products that are really moisturizing even though I have combination skin I do get oily in the t-zone I still like products that are really moisturizing this works really well but let me tell you do not put it on wet skin your face needs to be dry you just take a couple drops and you mix it in with a little bit of water just a tiny bit of water couple drops and rub it through your hands you put on your face and it does turn into an oil it does take off your makeup I would double cleanse with this I like to use this and follow it up with another cleanser if I have makeup on but if I'm using it in the morning first thing when I wake up I don't need to double cleanse this is enough I do think it's a wonderful product I would definitely repurchase this the only thing that I will say is at the top of it broke off so I just hope that they do a better job of making sure things like this are taken care of because it is a luxury product you're spending a lot of money so I would expect things to be intact this next product is my staple bass Lodge and I love it I love it it's the part sleeping facial cleanser and black currant seed and it's a gentle cleanser with a rich lather that's supposed to be good for all skin types and it does have mild exfoliation because it does have left an accident it it also does have some hellhole the oil in it three words for you guys love this cleanser this cleanser is my favorite and by the way if you purchase the cleansers make sure you ask for the pump it does not come with a pump top you need to ask for it this cleanser is super moisturizing and it's very thick it's not runny at all it's a really thick thick thick moisturizer my skin always feels very supple after using this but it does feel like it's cleansed and I love using this to mix with other brands that have exfoliators like powdered exfoliators I love mixing it together but I love this for cleaning my face it is more so geared towards people who have drier skin because it's so moisturizing if you have really oily skin I probably would recommend this it's very gentle only thing I don't like about this product is that when my hands are wet it doesn't so most nicely my face can be wet but my hands needs to be dry when I could to slope on my hands or else it won't lather up so that's something that I kind of wish was different because it is annoying but it works really well with Clarisonic or any kind of facial brush it works really well with that you just put a couple of pumps and it lathers like crazy so this is something that's holy grail for me I'll definitely repurchase it this next part is the purifying facial exfoliant paste and this is a facial exfoliator it's very mild it removes impurities on the skin it has five quarts rosemary and lactic acid in it as well I am obsessed with this this is my favorite facial exfoliator ever the product is white but it does have these little beads in it to exfoliate your face with but they're not harsh at all the smell of this is really weird I didn't particularly like smell of this it kind of smells like food to me and not food that I like it doesn't smell good at all in my opinion it does not worthy that maybe the rosemary in its giving it that smell and not a fan of the rosemary smell so it's probably that but this product works so well it takes off all the dead skin off my face my face isn't still dry after using it my face feels renewed so I love love love this exfoliator I use it maybe once a week if I remember my skincare it just you know it's I listen to my skin so if my skin needs to be exfoliated if it feels like a lot of gunk on it and it feels like it's really dirty just reset it for me so I love this product the six-pack is a face mask and it's called the blue calomel facial hydrating mask it has Nia sediment so the encouragin and visible in it and it supposed to be a hydrating facial mask to refresh soft it and replenish normal to dry skin so it was interesting for a facial mask to be in a little pump like this that was different usually the masks are like in jars but I have talked about this mask a lot in a lot of different videos this is one of my hands-down favorite moisturizing mask it's really hard to find a really good moisturizing face mask this is very very very potent it's very potent you only need a little bit and you just kind of put it onto your face it's clear as soon as you put it onto your face you will feel it's kind of stinging it you can tell something is working there's something going on with it and I love it I leave it on for about 30 to 45 minutes and then I just take my toner and I take a cotton swab and then wipe the mess off of my face with it that's another thing that I love about this mask because I don't have to wash it off with water I like masks that I can just take off with a toner it's super moisturizing so I love to use it right after I use a clay mask or any mask that's really purifying because it brings all of the moisture back into my face it's never let me down and everyone that I this mask on yes how many people try my stuff I think people who come over and I put the mask on that whether male or female has been so impressed by how well it works if I ever had to just take one mask that was super moisturizing it would be this one next pasta half is a parsley seed antioxidant serum and it has grape seed pessimal and parsley seed in it and it says a rich antioxidant do used moisturizer or normal to combination and sensitive skin it has grape and parsley seeds extra in it and after you cleanse until you're supposed to apply it to your hands and massage it into your face I'm new to using serums as a moisturizer as always use creams or gels on my face so this was different for me but it's pretty much almost finished because I really liked it and you just take a couple drops you put it onto your face I actually put it directly on to my face because I feel like that way I don't waste any product by sinking into my palms I bought that product on accident I meant to get the potent like small parsley seed antioxidant product but I got the wrong one and I ended up with bids but I actually liked it I used it the most in the winter time I used it during the day I would actually layer this underneath the parsley seed antioxidants actual lotion and my face was just like unbelievably moisturized moisture to a whole nother level but just using this product by itself it's fine it works as a moisturizer my face felt hydrated it felt moisturize I feel like I necessarily needed to put anything over it in the summer time I think this is going to be awesome for anyone who has oily to combination skin because it sinks into your skin and you don't need to put on a lotion and so it's light its Airy you can go out and not worry about feeling greasy now it's something I'll run out and go repurchase I wouldn't I wouldn't I probably would never repurchase that because it wasn't mind blowing it makes me just go wow my face looks so amazing it was just a good product so if you're looking for something like that I would go with it I didn't break out and have any adverse effects at all with it this next product is the bitter orange astringent toner and it has bitter orange in it witch hazel rosemary leaf and it's a toner that's supposed to help to smooth your face with a matte finish and you just will sees a cotton pad and rub it on your neck in your forehead so I just started using this toner about a month ago and I was just in need of a toner and it trusts ESOP so I went with it without really doing any research and that's another thing about this brand there's not that many reviews on YouTube I searched up and down when I first started getting into it try to find reviews so that I can know before I spend all that money but the reviews on YouTube were really scarce so I felt like I really needed to come back and do a review on all of these things so this toner is pretty good in my opinion it works I wasn't blown away by it but then again I'm not necessarily blown away by toners I do love my Chanel toner for the winter time it's awesome but this does the job it takes off all of the makeup or whatever residue or dirt was left on my face after washing and it works the smell is not my favorite I don't really like the way it smells and once again it does have rosemary in it so that might be what I'm smelling I wouldn't necessarily call this a gentle toner because you do feel that kind of sting that you feel and I think that's the witch hazel in it but it's not stripping at all my face doesn't feel like it was stripped after using it I think it's fine I'm not quite sure if I would ever repurchase it if it was available and I saw it maybe if I needed one but I would run out to go get it again the next part I have is called remove and it has grapeseed oil tocopherol which is vitamin E and blue chamomile and it's a gentle eye makeup remover that's oil-based so I bought this because I was running out of my Chanel eye makeup remover which is my favorite so I decided to try this one it's really tiny if you look at how small this is I wasn't expecting it to be this little this is the toner and this is a six point eight of the cleansing oil so you can see how small it is it's tiny it's only two fluid ounces and it's an eye makeup remover I did not like this product it really sticks on to your cotton pad as you're using it even though it's an oil I select it kind of soaks into the cotton pad and it doesn't give you a whole lot to work with I just didn't like the feeling it was what a feeling I felt on my fingertip with the cotton pad and the oil it just something about it did not work out for me this smells okay I wasn't crazy about the scent but it's not very strong I just don't think this pot is necessary I can take my makeup off with other things that are a lot less expensive I thought this was going to kind of like blow me away but in my opinion it's oh look at that it's a damp it's this a damp cotton pad look see I wasn't even following the direction I'm gonna have to wait on my review on this one because I just read that the cotton pad is supposed to be damp and I definitely never let it that's the thing about these kinds of products you have to use them the way that you're instructed to use them before you can say whether or not it works so I'm gonna have to get back to you on this this next product is the parsley seed antioxidant hydrator with white tea patent all willow herb in it and it's a light rapid absorbing facial moisturizing fluid that delivers super antioxidant hydration this is definitely my favorite moisturizer for the winter I've purchased this twice already and I love it I absolutely love it it's so thick and rich smell amazing and after I use it instantly my skin is plumped instantly hydrated instantly plump really supple looking very soft it does have a little bit of craziness to it there's a little bit of grease you can't use too much you only need a tiny amount I would say about half a dime-sized you just need a little bit if you put a lot on your face it's going to look a little bit oily a little bit greasy even under makeup using it my makeup would go on so flawlessly like I said if you use too much it can be a problem especially if you use a primer because of how thick this is it kind of turns into this kind of like grainy white text I can't really explain it but it's just it's a no-go it's not good so you need to use only a little bit within like two days of using the cleansing oil and this particular product my face was noticeably more supple so this is something I was definitely repurchase it says it's ideal for fatigue skin exposed to drying environment such as an office base or an airline cabin it refreshes and tones of skin like an congested by humidity or pollution so this is an interesting little product I wasn't when I initially bought it I bought it to use as a toner but I realized that it could have better uses this is one of those facial sprays that you use that are in an airplane you want to freshen up your face because you know your skin does kind of get yucky when you travel it's really small so you can put it in your purse or your bag and I like it I like the way it mists out the quality isn't the quality of the mister is really good because it does have a really clean light sprit I've never used it over makeup to see if it was like a setting spray but that's not how it's marketed so it's truly just to refresh your face I think it's a nice product it has a pretty decent smell kind of orangie I would repurchase it because I don't really need it and I really only want to keep things that I'm like in love with and not just things to have so I will finish it but it's not something that I'm going to repurchase another way I use it is right before I go to the gym I bring my face with it just to kind of refresh my face and tone it because I do wash my face right before I go to the gym all right you guys that was a lot that was a lot but thank you so much for sticking with me let me know if you have any questions about these products I love Esau I love the brand this isn't sponsored I purchased all of this with my own money but eats up if you do want to sponsor me

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMqezg9KfGI,everyone talking about audacious by Aesop this was just released recently in I think the very end of 2022 the notes in our pedigree black pepper frankincense cumin Cedar sandalwood and vetiver this is such a nice alluring toasted spiced wood scent very high quality classy and I think would come across as sexy to a lot of people so it's not just the type of classy thing that's like oh you're so fancy and professional or something like that like it's you know a nice mix of very captivating and also just kind of like yeah potentially sexy deep and Rich but still very easily wearable for my nose at least reminds me a tiny bit of Centaur devices which I love that one and I'm picky about that for everyone's house this I generally like Aesop in general so I'm not surprised that I like this but if you like the notes in here I think it's absolutely worth trying I don't even usually like cumin at all but it works for me with the way it's done here so you have you like a spiced incense Woods you know Sandalwood type of scent then I think that you would be a fan of this it does have low to moderate longevity and projection not a problem for me but if that's a deal breaker for you don't try it but I think it smells great and I think it's nice to have like a classy close option that kind of goes to me it's not sexy if it sent as massive projection because that's could come across as tryhard or something and that means if it's projecting that far by the time you're up close with someone it could be really strong so something like this is more suited for that type of bite to me but yeah unisex living masculine 195 for a 50 milliliter and I'll link in the description where you can check it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRwhteRhe0&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,have you ever wondered are asap products worth it well i've tested a few and here are the three asap products that i think are worth buying let's begin with the parsley seed facial cleansing oil i've been using this for years and i love it because it cleanses without dehydrating and leaves your face feeling perfectly refreshed the ingredients feature a medley of oils from nuts and seeds including macadamia nut sunflower seed and parsley seed to use i apply three to four drops directly to my face massage massage massage and then i rinse it all off with warm water next up is the lucent facial concentrate this one is my holy grail product i use it as a serum so i apply it after cleansing and toning and before moisturizer i love it because it smooths out my pores and adds a natural dewy glow to my skin it smells of light roses and is infused with vitamin c and b3 for a full breakdown of its ingredients i found this wonderful website that breaks down each ingredient into easy non-scientific terms which i will leave in the description box for those who are interested and finally we have the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i first bought this because an aesop store associate told me that the loosened facial concentrate is best paired with the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i love it because it is super hydrating and protects against environmental aggressors the only con is that it is rather fragrant so i would recommend this for those who have sensitivity to fragrance it is full of hydrating ingredients such as aloe vera leaf gel sweet almond oil and shea butter although a full breakdown of its ingredients will also be in the description box below and that wraps up my list at least so far of asap products worth buying i have been using these products for at least two years now and they're still my favorites so i think that's saying a lot though if you have any questions feel free to pop them in the comments below [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrYzkISxi1Y,okay it's 28 um the sculpt hair polish it's almost like a gel consistency consistency um not really a paste it kind of feels like a paste but it is like a gel it smells really good it smells like limes it doesn't say on here but it literally smells like limes um which also makes me think of a chocolate vacation but you kind of just like slick it in there like you want to be slick get all the baby hairs okay she's slick all right that's not the final product but i'm really like describing all the sounds but um that sounds like i swear just like straight line which smells incredible let's look at this baby back sometimes it's easier if you like shower and just already have one hair to slick this back um it doesn't help that i just had like super frizzy hair trying to slick it back but it is easier if it's already just wet this baby is okay this baby hand does not want to be tamed but okay very slick high up that was my downfall wasn't high enough um but you wanted to like the ear that's what tick-tock told me and then this scrunchie is also from vera shop it's sold out right now though it's like a bandana print um i think it'll be back in stock though it comes in this like green color it comes in white with black and black with white but i love a i'll just scrunchie it bam if you have longer hair you're probably going to have to wrap like the tail of your hair around a little more paste but yeah you want you want tight um but so what tic me was when you do it high up here you kind of almost get like a brother left out of it which is true um and i love that more gel which is good i'll show you the back i am getting a haircut later today so this is long for me so i feel like i have some like pieces sticking out the bottom um but usually i just have like this tiny little baby bun which i like but if you had longer hair i would just take like the tail piece and just wrap it around the scrunchie you could even do um make the little loop and tie it with like an elastic then wrap your hair around the elastic and then put the scrunchie over it that's probably what you should do if you have long hair um but if you have short hair i just use this energy because usually my hair is a little bit shorter but yeah select literally 90 of my vacations like if you look at my photos my hair looks like this i'm always looking it back it just makes it so much easier and i don't want to like fuss with my hair i made that look effortless wow because i'm like out of breath um but yeah i feel like i always end up wearing my hair like this because i just like don't have fuss with my hair on vacation usually because i'd rather just like get out there and like enjoy where i am and like i feel like this looks cute when you have a really cute outfit on too um i'm just like i'm just like bandy but yeah just nice and easy i do want to show you all right let's look at some scrunchies real quick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caISSnykeUs,to you guys but I just loved it I also has the Mandarin rind the rosemary leaf um me and Peter so it feels really warm oh someone just asked a question what size bottle are you guys talking about the body 1.6 ounces the body wash is 16. this is 16.9 ounces so it's a good big size and it's a pump bottle so yeah and I reused this bottle like even if you don't use it in the shower you can use it in the kitchen when you're doing the dishes put in some just keep reusing and refilling yeah or I'll be sustainable when it comes to packaging reusing things so this I just love these kind of hand creams I keep these in my purse see just a little goes a long way and I love the texture of it because it's a cream and it's like acts like a balm but it's not too heavy and like too I don't know how to describe it but sometimes smell come on like the really hard that's red but this one feels up my face like butter it goes on super smooth and easily it has Rosemary Mandarin smells like a fresh Garden so yeah so so I this is kind of doubles as a fragrance too yeah you can kind of just dab it like after you say you're sweaty and you're out and you just went into the bath you just went to the bathroom washed your hands use this and I kind of put it behind my ear yeah definitely so that is awesome like a little fragrance it's a good idea so it's a hand balm I love it on the elbows we put the extra love on the knees and I also love to use it as a foot cream because you know it's summer we're all wearing sandals make your want to show off cute painted toenails which I actually don't have right now but that's okay um but yeah you just want to look fresh and super moisturized especially since we're burying so much skin right now and all of this heat exactly um and I carry this in my purse and I love the like I'm not sure what it's made it's like aluminum or something but I just like as I keep using it just squeeze them out the bottle keep um folding it over so that I keep moving the product forward and it's super close it on my shoulders especially here just like helps massage and kind of unwind so this was good to keep in your purse it's like that little dose of like wellness a little fragrance anywhere you go anywhere you go show you guys like the multi-dimensionality of all of these products all the different ways that they can be used Beyond just what they're actually just intended for um so yeah we're a huge fan of this balm and I love it yeah I love it as a fragrance anywhere on your body is just instantly gonna like give you a little touch a little like refresher without being too overbearing because we don't exactly usually people don't like their hand creams even have fragrance at all um but ASAP just does such a good job and just at just making it feel super like it's very like a natural set yeah kind of changes on everybody so someone said thanks for mentioning me it's an arms that's where wrinkles are bad yeah that's true first signs of aging actually and I always want to make sure even always make sure to like use the body wash extra love right here in the chest area since this area is being super exposed during the daytime to the sun and the elements like you always want to give that an extra cleanse um yeah just don't forget about any part top to bottom you know exactly especially the fingertips but it's true the knees elbows feet neck all like really gentle so yeah and then we just wanted to quickly show you guys another product we love by ASAP this is the resurrection rinse free hand Mist since we're talking about you know well I mean this is like yes Beauty not cool a necessity right now it just falls into the category of just like overall Wellness um so yeah I've always had a hard time and it doesn't stink yeah I'm so dead really bad hand sanitizers at restaurants that just smell bad and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdJNoCwP04o&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,hi everyone so today I will be reading all the ASA products that I have tried and what I'm going to do is for each product I will talk about what I like the most about it what I dislike and if I would buy them again and so first I'm just gonna give a brief overview so I do have quite the Aesop collection um this is my skin care products and then I also do have some of their body care products as well so for I will be going into skincare first so first we're going to talk about the Aesop cleanser so this is a fabulous face wash and as you can see um it is almost out so I really really do like this cleanser and for context my skin is oily combination sensitive um sensitive oily but mainly in my t-zones so the fabulous face wash I really like this product I have used uh the use of the people cleanser before but I felt like it just isn't that interesting so I decided to try this Aesop face wash and I really like the way it feels on my face because it feels very cleansing but it does not feel stripping and it just smells so good and it just feels amazing so I will definitely be repurchasing this one thing however that I would like to know is that the pump is a little bit annoying when you are traveling so if you have this in like a bag or something um it's gonna spill I mean there's just I couldn't figure out a way to like package this without spilling but I probably wasted at least a third of the bottle because um it spilled out when I have been traveling and I believe this product this is a 200 millimeters um it has lasted me since I think maybe April of this year and as I did say before um I just spilled about a third of this bottle so it is September now so and it's still going quite strong so and for this you only really need a tiny tiny bit so I love the cleanser okay so now to continue we're going into the toner B and T balancing toner so I just started using this toner but before I started using it I have um used a travel like a sample size of the toner and I really liked it so um I decided to purchase a faux bottle this is the 200 millimeter as well and actually even though it's in like a car form it's very easily to dispense and it only dispenses a few drops at a time so I think that's really convenient but I like this because it's alcohol free and it's very soothing for your face but it still does the job of a toner however I will say that um I don't think this product is spectacular not like the face wash so I would give this product maybe like a six out of ten in terms of also just a price because this is pretty expensive I believe this toner is about 60 dollars for the 200 milligram but I did buy it on sale from the website if Chic so um sometimes you can find them on else so I think that's a good tip but yeah I will say that if you are looking for a toner this does the job but I will say that there probably are better toners out on the market but this is a really solid product that you know is a good staple routine if you're just looking for something simple okay and then to continue I have the fur mask so I have the Primrose facial cleansing mask this is also in 120 milligram milliliters so the bigger size so this I have also tried before I purchased um one thing I love about Aesop is that they have a lot of samples so you can really just try out their products before you purchase and these products are pretty pricey so I definitely recommend that um I also believe this was around sixty dollars and it is a clay mask as you can see um but I really really like this clay mask I think that this clay mask feels really really great on my face and it draws out like my oils and impurities like I couldn't visibly kind of see it like drawing it out and also this clay mask feels very comfortable and does not feel too tight and also too harsh on my skin um I have pretty sensitive skin so I'm always looking for products that are gentle but still gets the job done however with that said I don't think this is a perfect mask or anything like that um I will give this a 7.5 out of 10. and I'll just do rate also the fabulous face wash I would give this a 9 out of 10. yes and then to continue so I have the parsley seed antioxidant intense serum this Serum is quite expensive at 98 after tax um so you know I should really pack a punch but I will say though I bought this serum in May and it is September so it's been three months and I've used about one third of the bottle so it does last quite a long time um so this serum promises it I bought it because it promises to um form a breathable antioxidant film on the skin and I actually do believe that this serves the purpose well obviously I can't you know scientifically prove that it forms an antioxidant layer but I do feel like this Serum is great for protecting my skin and I do think it is a really great serum it feels super super good on the skin and once you get again you only need about two drops of this serum so and it's not too oily it's not too heavy um I love the way it feels but I do think the price point is a little bit steep um I would buy this again but but I would just because it's 98 dollars um I would rate it at 8 out of 10 but I do think that this delivers to what it does so I think this is a pretty good product okay and then to round out the skincare routine I have the lightweight facial hydrating serum this is actually my second bottle so you can tell I love this serum and for context um I think the first bottle lasted me four months which I think is a pretty long time for a moisturizer so this bottle I think is around 60 dollars once again a little bit steep uh but I do love love this moisturizer um this is the first thing I tried at Aesop and this is the product that really like sold me on Aesop so I recommend this moisturizer I think it's just a great overall moisturizer and it just it's for combo oily or sensitive skin which I believe I have all three so um this moisturizer feels really really great on my face but once again I do think this is best for oily skin so if your skin is not oily um I would not recommend this but I think this is a great moisturizer um actually would give this a 10 out of 10. I I really really love this moisturizer just when you put it on like it feels so soothing and even though it seems like it's oil based or it's not oil based but the droplets are quite thick um it does not feel thick on your face at all I think it feels amazing and I love this product okay and then I think the last thing I have about skin care is the Aesop um lip balm I actually got this for free from Aesop but I believe it's 15 if you buy it um I think that's a little bit ridiculous for a lip balm although this does have SPF um it just it's just a lip balm you know and I don't even think this is a great lip balm because it kind of when you put it on your lips um the lip balm is very rigid so it doesn't feel as nourishing as some of the other lip balms I've tried but you know it is a lip balm so it does its job and it does have SPF which is great but just for 15 dollars um I think you can get something better this is pretty basic I would give this a 5 out of 10. so yeah okay so now moving on to the hair care products so I do have the Aesop shampoo and conditioner in the bigger size I think this is the 500 milliliters and these are fifty dollars each so a hundred dollars for a set um so for shampoo I have the equalizing shampoo which is for a balancing formulation for those with oilier scalps to remove excess oil without causing aggravation and then I just have the normal conditioner um I don't think they have that many other conditioners so I will compare my hair care products to olaplex because I um used to use olaplex but I will say that I do really like the shampoo and conditioner first of all especially the way it smells it just smells amazing especially the conditioner it smells so good like um so the shampoo I think cleanses my hair really well um like I said it is for if you have a oilier scalp so definitely do not buy this if you have fine hair but um also I like that you know it's 500 milliliters I believe the olaplex shampoo is about half the size and it's 30 dollars so I think value wise um I think that the shampoo and conditioner are decent values because I think it will last a long time since the shampoo I only need to use um about I would say either a full pump or half a pump depending on how dirty my hair is so but once again I don't think their shampoo and conditioners are magical it's not magical it kind of just does what it says it does it's not going to go you know above and beyond um so at this price point it is a little steep I would say I would give the shampoo and conditioner both a 7.5 out of 10. and I probably would buy again depending on how long it lasts but I think I will buy again and then for this conditioner um honestly yeah the shampoo I think I would give a 7.5 out of 10 but I think in a conditioner I'll give a 6.5 out of 10 because I just feel like it is nourishing and it is great on my hair but um you know I think it could be a little better like it could be more it could be giving more for how mature pain but the conditioner smells so good that I think I would buy it again just because of how great it smells I I just I love the scent it smells so good so yeah and then my last hair care product is actually the rose hair and scalp moisturizing mask um so this is the 120 milliliter size um I think this is about thirty dollars I don't remember um also I will say that ASAP in Europe is cheaper than the price in America so if you can't try to buy in Europe um I don't really love this mask it's a hydrating mask but I'm also just a little bit lazy because the way this mask works is uh um you apply it to like washed hair but you do have to wash the hair mask out and I'm a little bit lazy so honestly I don't really use this that much but I should use it more um I think it does get the job done it's for you know scalp if your scalp is dry but I think my scalp isn't dry so this just isn't really the product for me I probably shouldn't have bought it but I do think it is a hydrating hair mask but um I just don't really love hair masks so I would not buy this again I'm not like that impressed I'm just gonna try to um use this up because you know I'm not gonna waste my money but I wouldn't buy this again I give this like a 4 out of ten I think you could just buy any hair masks that's cheaper and they probably will do the same thing this is not nothing revolutionary okay so my last ASAP product is the Aesop mouthwash so first of all I just love this bottle and I love that it comes with this really cute like mouthwash Beaker um it's just so cute like that's the reason I bought it not for you know a mouthwash purpose but just because it's so cute and I will say this is the best tasting mouthwash I have ever tried it is but it is crazy overpriced this mouthwash is 29 and it really does not last that long I think I used it for a month and a half and it went out so I actually refilled it with a different mouthwash because I am not buying 30 Mouse wash again um that was just like a one-time thing so I think the mouth I mean if you have the money I say go for it because it's a gray mouthwash um it tastes really good but does it need to be 30 dollars no it does not so I think the mouthwash 5 out of 10 um will not purchase it again just because it is expensive but you know once again she is beautiful she tastes amazing so yeah okay and that is all for today for my Aesop skin care and body hair products I hope you like this video um please like comment and let me know what you think thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgLv0DjhbKI,so as you can see from a Titan already this is going to be an ace of horror but yeah so if you want to seize my favorite favorite products for my one my favorite brands keep on watching [Music] so you might be thinking brie well why do you think we care about what you own from a sock I'll tell you why because you might be thinking of buying to the brand I might not be sure what to buy and this would give you an idea of what the products like how it performs before you make your own decisions so some of these I've been using religiously a lot for years I've just been fired back into them I saw them in new ones that I've tried and yeah let's jump right in let's jump right so I just want to say I thought all of this with my own money this is not sponsored this is not gifted yes I spent a lot of money own a Saab but this is what I love so this is what it is is what it is right so the first product is this which is the mouthwash yes I know it mouthful for meso lovely so anyway so this map mouthwash mouthwash contains clothes but honesty and spare mint leaf for a massive bottle for half a hundred mil this is I think it was 17 pounds that's a really good price and it lasts for ages absolutely ages and it normally comes with like a small glass measuring thing which we never use because we just pop that back in me you know do what you got to do but this is now our second bottle that we bought I say we my husband and I I bought and yeah I love it so the ingredients in there so the sales books Pearman sleeve oil mmm it's got tea tree oil yeah so it's quite baby free great it's quite fragrant one mmm so that's peer mentoring them you know it's extra yes I was like extra Spearman that's it yeah anyway love it love it love it love it so this one's one not me to continue to buy all the time love it really good price then the next one is the as the geranium body cleanse up now they have two body cleansers they have this one I also have the rose one the geranium one is my favorite and that's because I love this Mediterranean but I've also been using the Rose one recently but I'm gonna go back this geranium so in draining one it's for joining leaf of course mandarin rind and bergamot and it says it's aromatic body cleansing gel for all skin types fabulous alternatives regular soap enhance with geranium leaf to cleanse without drying the skin I have to agree this does not dry the skin which is why I've been buying this for a very long time and the big size of this so I'm not enough however the price off top my head I'm gonna list everything down below so you can scroll down have a loot your self bother do this in two sizes the 500 mil and a 200 mil I always buy the 500 mil it lasts for ages absolutely ages it smells amazing the only thing I will say is though this is in plastic which is not great okay slight technical issue there and so the background might not be as it was before or the crops but anyway sorry about that here's what it is so yes I was talking about the ESOP in fact that this is plastic and I would like to make a suggestion to a stop if you know they want to do it because I think it's good grade yeah but if they've made these recyclable I can bring them back to their stores and then you may get like 10 percent off your next buy or whatever I'm at and one they want to do I think they will be able to reuse a lot of these which is what a lot of the brands other brands do just a thought just a thought on the environment and then this one is going pulse it by I'm being very honest and didn't need to buy a time bomb now I am hoped and this is the what's been missing okay this is the automatic hand wash and it has this little air route thermalize Betsy grain which is like little granules in it and bacon burger monch grind as well this is exfoliating hand wash with finely milled promise to gently swell for hands love this I've never had a hand wash with I wanna grind I'm gonna call it grinders a compromiser what permiss probably and oh guys oh my god let me just tell you your hand washing experience will never be the same again when you buy this but now I'm hooked I'm always gonna buy this for scrubs I've got this which is oh no this is gonna be very hard to show because it's reflexive oh there we go so it's the geranium leaf body scrub this has got bamboo stem furnace again and geranium it says the highly effective body exfoliant with a refreshing scent this wonderful scrub contains a precisely burn ratio of permits and bamboo to revive and stimulate the skin revealing the fresh skin perfectly prepared for hydration so use once twice a week why when you use it you're massaging and damp skin bring self I love it it's a bit of the one the expensive ones we say again postman yeah this is a bit an expensive one if I'm being honest I don't know if I buy this again it was very very nice to use before body scrub it's a bit much she's a bit much I'm not gonna buy this again but it was a nice experience there but if you've got that kind of dough and you want to experience it yourself you can go right ahead but yeah it's not so good just uranium luxury there and then the other that's feeling that I've got is a facial one so this is the purifying this is the purifying facial exfoliant paste and this has got fine quartz mmm fancy rosemary leaf elastic I said plus for me and you apply to damp skin with clean hands gently work over the face and the neck and don't forget the neck with smooth circular strokes and then winds up great granular pumice however you want to call it oh let's see oh there we go there you go yeah so you can't really see on camera but it feels it's just it just really lovely lovely exfoliant it looks fun it's really nicely and like all their products they're very fragrant showed it again yeah there you go yeah so really tiny granule was all permissiveness from this one I would buy this one again I use this once or twice a week that is well I think I said which if you saw my other video on face wash face washes yeah cleansers and I thought about elastic I said which is a lovely exfoliant there's a very mild one could have sensitive skin so there's someone definitely yeah we've got the parsley seed facial cleanser this is probably my oh say what six or seven bottle yes so this one's got licorice root lattic acid again and black currant seed so it says the gentle gel cleanser rich leather from most skin types offers the additional benefits of mild exfoliation of the lactic acid and balancing from Hopa oil so skin will feel completely cleanse clarified and softened and this one and this one has got sodium laureth sulfate which some people don't like everyone that does it the week it gives that kind of foaming homey feel some people don't like this quite it could be quite drying on the skin I personally don't have a problem with it it doesn't dry my skin at all but I have what combination the skin so if you've got very dry skin this might not be for you and it's very fragrant so one thing about all the ASA products which I personally love is fact that they smell gorgeous but if you're not really into framing especially for skin care body is fine buddy yeah you know you had that kind of lovely inspire experience in your own bathroom but if you don't like fragrant stuff for your face because you're sensitive then this Brahma not be for you for face I will continue to buy this until they stop using stop using it not not stop using it right it's not making it but please a stop please no stop making this because this is my ride-or-die you love her they do this in two sizes so there's a hundred mil no aah oh God sorry operate under yeah good price one as well you've seen that the price point I mean you know that's my opinion this is their primrose facial hydrating cream with sage leaf rose me leaf and lavender stem stem so it's a daily moisturizing proof an orange dry at or stressed skin I don't have dry skin I don't know have look how you work normally it's balanced not normal because what the other skins are normal normal normal Fallon skin I don't have dry skin I do something have stress skin I use this I was using this religiously for a while but now I've incorporates all things into my skincare routine just cuz I try different things to review on my Instagram which if you don't follow me on Instagram please follow me it's not that braids underscore it's me and this one is a 60 mil they do to a bigger size which I would recommend to get only because this is a has a 12 month shelf life and it lasts for ages because you only need the pea size for moisturizer you don't need that much this will last you for ages so I recommend just get the 60 and then that's all this is a very funny one this is the post Pooh drops exactly what it is it's a post per drop this is great in your bathroom because if you if you have guests that don't it bit of a nasty in the bath they can just put the Sun Drop top and it take a smell away to an extent what I like to do is drop it in before I do my business and then drop it in after I flushed so then you've got like smell from hints that's it for me let's clean all the bad smells this has got tangerine peel the onion and Mandarin so it's very citrusy type of smell it smells really nice I suppose it's a comment across with a pipette and when you when you draw it out you li get oh this much out of it so don't think it's broken it's not broken that's just because you don't need that much doing too poor for pipette into the toilet I love this one huh and what is read always says it says in instances in instances where vigorous activity has occurred in the property room dilute several drops of this carefully crop but this gives you crafted products in the toilet bowl after flushing for the benefits of all subsequent businesses you get it just get the gist then we've got this which is the face mist this is my second bottle this is their immediate facial hydrosoul hydrosol miss whatever this is my second one this has got rose petal bergamot again come my bud so he's ideal for fatigue skin exposed to dry and condition vironment such as an office or airline cabin the refreshes and tones congested by humidity and pollution excuse me I'm pollution it's just fine at first but when you buy this one again because it's a little bit of a power I remember taking this on the flight ones and I used the whirls on the flag and it was just saver powering firstly I should have used this on a flight because you shouldn't doing a skincare with soon enough right but that's not really enough another video I've got a video for that skincare routine what to do if you want your skin looking amazing for the flight you should be doing it in the flat but anyway so I I did use a sort of fly and it was just sort of powering and I felt bad for the guy next time because he was just like this intense sense in the air it's a bit much there's a bit too more empowering so if you like a kind of thing yeah get it they call it comes on one size which is the 60 mil as well love that sorry and then there's one more thing which I haven't got on me at the moment and that is I have got hand sanitizer from them and it comes in a little cute little bottle I think it's 30 or 40 email and it's about 7 pounds love it I am a beach therapist so I'd only use it for I start with my clients and it just gives them that kind of nice relaxing scent experience so that's it that is all of my obsession
