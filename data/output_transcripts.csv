https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPy26X2eU&t=11s&ab_channel=MarkKwak,hi everyone my name is mark quak and we're talking about my favorite things i struggle with today's product because i i love this product but at the same time it's hard for me to recommend to people because it's like is it worth it is it not worth it so expensive for what it is but you know what i'm just gonna talk about it because it is actually one of my favorite things the aesop resurrection aromatique hand wash it's soap hand soap aesop is a brand that i have loved kind of the the design and look of for so long it's it's a kind of aspirational brand because frankly if i bought aesop everything like my moisturizers were asap everything was just aesop i'd be bankrupt the truth is no one needs this product no one needs to use this product whatsoever and it's not it's not even i won't even say it's worth the money even though it's a great product it's a dilemma in my head because like i know i shouldn't be buying products like this but i also love products like this it's a dilemma and i'm sure many of you guys who either own aesop products or have thought about it are in a very similar position so let me talk specifically about their i i think this is their number one product the most popular product in their whole catalog the story behind this my story at least is that i saw this soap at a bunch of restaurants like high-end restaurants in san francisco if you go to a nice dinner it's a celebration maybe it's a birthday maybe it's you know an anniversary and then you know at some point during the meal you're probably gonna have to go to the bathroom right so you do and this aesop resurrection is waiting for you there you give it a couple pumps and you start washing your hands you're like oh my god this thing smells so awesome the experience of that bathroom because you know these are nice restaurants so they probably have nice lighting in there and all this stuff all of it is like a great hand washing experience like something that is a mundane and like normal task becomes this kind of experience getting this hand soap in your own home like you get a bit of that experience so the product itself like it is a great hand soap it is the consistency is good the smell and the the aroma is like is really awesome like it feels great going in the hand there's not much that makes it like revolutionary but it's ever so much better than all the other hand washes you use that you actually remember it or think about it a little and that's what made me purchase this product this is the cream of the crop this is the one that i think is the gold standard now anytime you go out and come back in you're washing your hands like a ton so each time you get that nice experience because you have a great soap but what are the cons to this like what are the issues now it's really all about the price right it's like at the end of the day the big con is that this is a forty dollar hand soap forty dollar hand soap i can't even say that without feeling ridiculous you can get soft soap from target for two dollars sort of that 38 delta it's it's that being said i mean i guess you do get a decent amount this is 17 fluid ounces and also you don't need that much soap like each pump is not a huge amount going away so it does last for months but you know it doesn't stop it from being a 40 hand soap at the end of the day it still is and alongside that the extra negative thing here is that if you want to refill this if you want to let's say you know get a big jug and just refill this bottle you can't like they only sell it in this size essentially and they have a refillable version that does not have this pump for one dollar less so normally this is thirty 39 you can get like a 38 one without this little pump so you're saving a dollar i mean so overall you know in a year you might spend instead of spending i don't know 10 15 on hand soap you might spend 120 so it's up to you whether you think that's worth the money or not i do vouch for the brand aesop in terms of their quality of their products though like i've i have been lucky enough to own maybe about four or five of their products i've had their deodorant i have a lot like a hand lotion i have been lucky enough to try a bunch of different asop products and all of them are excellent there really is a quality difference now whether it's worth you know 500 percent the price 600 800 the price that's really up to you but i can at least vouch that the product is quality so overall my thought is if you want to treat yourself and you wash your hands a ton which you should be right now and you just want that zing that extra zing in your life of something that you you know you're fed up with uh just like mundane life and you want that kind of extra experience aesop resurrection hand soap this is my recommendation here i struggle because it's so effing expensive but you know if you want that top of the line experience this is this is the one i would recommend massive struggle to get this video out because i don't really want to showcase how bougie i am but it is great it is great i have to admit so one of my favorite things thanks so much for watching i'm mark kwok and i will see you on the next one [Music]

architectural Digest Magazine is a brand that's been around since 1987. so we're getting some people in the office to use the brujiest 40 hand wash and getting their thoughts pulled in another tribute okay so I'm just gonna get you to wash your hands with this this is Celine she's from Germany wow what that was so unexpected it has like grainy stuff in it what is it called it's like exfoliating oh yeah exfoliating sorry I'm German he has a fellow Aussie quite nice it's not too abrasive here's Colin I just found him it feels really good I didn't even expect this this is really like taking me to a new place I've never been before as far as hand soaps this is Brandon I feel like this is a most serious hand washing experience than what I generally have and it smells good too not just a normal hand soap I would go with you can buy a hand soap normally I don't mean I don't maybe one or two dollars tell me what you think this costs maybe 30 to 50 bucks okay you would actually be right there's just something so satisfying in products that are designed classically simply and traditionally whether you care for bougie high-end soaps hand bombs or even perfumes there is one brand Within These ranks that have actually been producing skin care since its Inception about three decades ago and I'm sure you've seen it and if you're not convinced even Haley Biebs is on board as Nano likes to make them in the cupcake tin no not the muffins yep right there that's why today we're gonna be exploring ESOP like do people come in and say it differently people say ASAP all the time the brand is called Esau is and they've managed to stay ahead of the trends while remaining largely silent subscribe so my curiosity actually started about a month ago when I was back home in Australia and I realized walking around that their Pinterest like aesthetic Spa stores no two of them were the same they were all uniquely different from the marble sinks to the brass tapware and all their clean shelves oh my God kiss and when covid hit it was a time when everyone was really concentrating on hand hand washing which propelled their already cult favorite hand wash even further to become mainstream especially for people who wanted a little bit of self-care so that it wasn't just a chore to wash our hands it was more of an experience a new life pleasure if you will and don't underestimate our humble hands because the hand washing Market was worth 2.5 billion in 2020 but that's projected to be doubled and worth about 5 billion your hand is like the closest thing to your face skin that's why we do everything like on the back yeah even when we try skincare we put it on the back of your hand and now we're going to wrap your hand thank you thank you yay this is like the best part of a manicure too yes exactly but it's not just all about our hands right what else did this brand do to turn mainstream while keeping so humble and it all started in Melbourne Australia when a hairdresser by the name of Dennis perfidas began mixing essential oils into hair products because he realized how bad the ammonia in these hair dye products smelt so you wanted to alleviate and make it more of a pleasurable experience as people were getting their hair done if you've never seen their products you might have recognized some of this since and is probably in some combination of Rosemary citrus peel Bergamot or even cedar because all the products within the ESOP brand are formulated with essential oils and the formulations combine both natural and lab made ingredients that are known for their earthy and herbal scents let's now look a little bit into the aesthetic starting from the bottle the black and white lettering between alternating black and cream solids is pretty ident defiable from miles away they use minimalistic wording using the fonts helvetica and Optimum medium and the macron die critic which is this straight bar over the E on the label lets you know that it's pronounced ESOP so even from this it's kind of a brand that's like if you know you know now before we get into my review let's talk about price in an interview with Dennis where he was asked about the price of the hand bomb he was basically unperturbed critics are at the Liberty to use other products there's no justification required we make exceptional products with great care and attention so there you go that's badass because he's just super confident about the quality of his products you might have even noticed that they don't really do marketing like you haven't seen them on billboards buses you haven't really heard from them from influences so what do they actually do to get their name out there it really is just through organic word of mouth so to get into the mood of the hall let's go and spray my living room and then we'll continue that foreign [Music] so I got my hands on about 10 new products from the ESOP line all in different categories from skincare to mouthwash toothpaste serums and so I want to let you know which ones I think are worth spending the money on which ones if you haven't tried anything from them you might want to explore and which ones maybe are just worth the skip okay so let's start on I guess the cult favorite which is the hand wash or the bomb like the body bomb or the hand bomb I have the reverence aromatic hand wash this is actually one of the two main lines of their hand wash products each of them go for forty dollars each and it's in this 16.9 fluid ounce or 500 mL so I know 40 dollars is pretty steep for you know a hand wash if you compare it to a lot of other brands in this range like LA labo or even by radio forty dollars actually sits snugly in the middle because I know buy radio sells ones for like 60 something dollars the labo has like a hand soap that goes for 55 this is the reverence as I said and I actually prefer this over the cult favorite the resurrection aromatic hand wash and this is actually the version that contains finely milled pumice so this one does have that physical exfoliation property which I really love because it's like that extra like luxury at home or spa-like experience that you can recreate at home some people might not like you know the exfoliating properties every single day or using it every time they wash their hands so I'd say this is also a great like alternative to having other soaps and hand washes and I won't go for this all the time so in that respect I can see why this isn't like a necessity but if you want to go for more of that everyday hand wash I would suggest that you can find the ones without the pumice stone so I really love this one it is the reverence and I actually had no idea what reverence really meant so I Googled it and it is defined as deep respect expect for someone or something which I love I just find it really does make a difference when you know you're washing your hands and you're like and you're really like in tune with what you're smelling how it's making you feel as a practice of presence so moving on the next thing I picked up in the store was the Lucent facial concentrate so when I picked it up off the shelf I looked at the ingredients it's got rose petals sodium ascorbal phosphate and niacinamide so from this we know it's a vitamin C and niacinamide serum designed to balance combination as well as oily skin types the most exciting thing for this room is that I realized and solidified while it was in Australia that I think I react to Ill ascorbic acid because two or three times that I've tried a new vitamin C serum I instantly get like really irritated itchy and I have a rash like a low-key rash for about two weeks for it to fully disappear so so then right at the end of my trip was when I got this and I'm like okay I'm gonna try a derivative of vitamin C to see if it still happens and I didn't break out I didn't get a face rash I didn't get irritated it wasn't drying and I can tell you I love it so the serum is this really lightweight gel consistency then I looked into the ingredients and found that it actually does have an extract of red algae which is called sodium carrageenan and then the finish of it was that it left my face feeling like a little bit tacky and then I fanned it out a little bit and then it just like really dissolved into my skin to become more of this like satin to like semi mattifying almost but really hydrated people hate on essential oils all the time but me being a person with sensitive skin I actually found that this worked better than like other ingredients that aren't formulated with so it just goes to show so it depends on the oil it depends on your skin it depends on everyone what I don't love is the price it's a hundred and twenty dollars and I'm like whoa okay that's that's pretty expensive but I would say if I think about it people are selling vitamin C serums for more than a hundred dollars anyway those vitamin C's might be saying that it's pure ill ascorbic acid which is why they can charge high for it because it's you know the the source of vitamin C but then to me now I'm like I can't even use those products anyway next is actually a kit so in the store when we were browsing they had these like boxes so there was two there was an arrival and a departure and because I was about to leave back to New York I was like you know what the departure sounds good and actually it was far superior to the arrivals I would say because it comes with seven different products either a mini sized or full sized so this is a great way I feel feel like if you want to try a bunch of their products without committing to full size can I tell you this kit is a 10 out of 10. you get a lip product there's a toothpaste there's a hydrating mask which is like a moisturizer there's the resurrection aromatic hand balm in the small version then they have a rinse free hand wash Perfection mouthwash even more Perfection and this immediate moisture facial hydrosol which is a facial Mist I first want to start off with this blue chamomile facial hydrating mask whoa whoa whoa this is essentially like a hydrating overnight mask you can use it two ways using it as a 30 minute mask and then you wipe the excess off and just like Pat the rest in or you can use it as like your moisturizer to sleep overnight and then wash it off in the morning what it contains is niacinamide sodium carrageenan which is that red algae again and bisibal which is the blue chamomile we've heard of bitterball in a lot of soothing calming like Korean formulated skincare products Lord knows everyone who's been on a long distance flight has come off the plane with five new pimples cracked skin you're just dehydrated you're like cops and it's just not cute so before the flight I went into the bathroom washed my face did my whole routine using the hydrate uh the hydrosol facial Mist as well as this I kid you not when we arrive back in New York got off the plane even Thomas was like your skin looks great something of that form I was like still half asleep but I was like what and then I went to the toilet looked in the mirror and I was like oh my God I only applied this once throughout the time from Taiwan back to New York and my skin was actually plump and it looked like you know when you first wake up your Skin's like a little bit puffy but it looks really smooth and it's really like plump that was actually how my skin looked using this and that was the first time I've ever stepped off a plane and had that feeling normally I'm itchy I have a bajillion pimples my T-Zone is all over the place and then I have to recover for the next five days so I was like whoa if you're looking for a soothing calming overnight mask that can do it like okay so let's talk about the hydrating Mist next it's called the immediate moisture facial hydrosol this one is a beautiful scent once again like more of that earthy woodsy Rosy scent I would say this one is not a standout in my view because I've used a bunch of really like great facial Mist like I enjoy the quarterly one more because it has that layer of like essential oil oils and it did the job of toning my face hydrating my face prepping my face pairing up these two on the flight but I don't think I'll be repurchasing this one so the next thing quickly is the resurrection aromatic hand bomb remember I was saying that they have reverence and Resurrection for the hand wash and hand bomb this is just the small one of the Resurrection the consistency of the hand bombs are so great because it's not too thick it's also not sticky which I really despise I don't like anything that's actually overly thick and hydrating for a handbag um it was the best duo that came with the rinse free hand wash that they have so this is also the resurrection rinse free hand wash so see what I mean where they produce multiple products within the same Aroma line so these two are like a matching pair and it's got the same notes you can buy this for ten dollars individually as well if you need it didn't leave a sticky feeling it wasn't like overly aromatic or smell like alcohol you know sometimes a lot of them smelling alcohol much more subtle than the hand cream so if you're going for something where you want people to smell your hands as you move it around then hand cream is the way to go but um the hand wash is a nice subtle scent that eventually Fades and it doesn't leave any sort of residue on your hand so you feel nice fresh and clean another thing that I got convinced through this was actually twofold so once at the store Thomas is a fan of mouthwash he loves you know Crest mouthwash any sort of mouthwash he uses it every day and I'm like you are not putting that on the bathroom counter so when we went in there I was like oh there's a mouthwash do you want to try it and he's like yeah okay so he tries it gives me a cup as well and then I tried it and I was like oh my God and then the departure kit actually has a mini mouthwash how considerate this is just like more fresh than it is painful I would say other ones are kind of like painful and burning you know oral hygiene is a thing I went to the dentist for the first time in six years I'm not proud of it and I realized that I had a bunch of cavities and I might need to take out all four of my wisdom teeth and I was like modified this is your reminder to floss every day so I would highly recommend you go to the ESOP store and try their mouthwash okay the last two things is a lip product as well as a toothpaste so let's start with the Cedar and citrus lip self so this is nice because your lips are perpetually parched even if you're like me and they're not normally dry they're dry on the plane let me tell you the ingredients for this one is grapefruit rind Ceda Atlas and orange rind this is really interesting it's like a gel oil lip product or like lip ointment and it's not thick and I've been using this before I go to sleep and it just keeps it nice and supple and it actually smells Divine it gives your lips more of a glossy finish compared to you know your typical lip balm but I will say that it wears off faster than like your like thick beeswax type of bombs so just depending on what it is that you want although the oil really does hydrate I don't know among other things if I would repurchase this one but for me it's a nice to have and very enjoyable to use because it's not sticky last thing is this toothpaste if you don't know mint is added into toothpaste just to give you that psychological feeling that you're fresh and clean right but it doesn't actually do much other than the feeling of moment it feels like a really clean toothpaste it doesn't foam and froth like another Colgate or like Crest you know typical toothpaste does but it just like cleans the teeth and gums and still has that minty freshness but just subdued and subtle so if you're into like clean toothpastes or the feeling of kind of like clean toothpaste I feel like this is something that you actually might enjoy so I would say if you're traveling guys try and get this departure kit next is also in the Wheelhouse of like aromatherapy it's the ginger flight therapy so this is essentially a roll-on like aromatic oil it's got ginger root lavender and geranium so I thought this would be just a fun purchase more than anything it's got the effects of soothing mentally and what you do is just roll this onto all your pulse points like you can put it on your temple your neck your wrists and from those areas that generate heat it will help like I don't know have that Aroma around but I have been using this uh since we got back at night because I'm still jet lagged and I can't sleep at night and I'm wide awake at 4am and so hasn't been able to put me to rest not really but I do feel calm it's also great to have in the office just as kind of like your pick-me-up as well if you need a little reset so I would say my top three items that I would recommend would be these three the reverence aromatic hand wash the facial concentrate with vitamin C and niacinamide as well as the uh blue chamomile facial hydrating mask those are so awesome so the story of Aesop to me really tells of staying in your lane producing products that are high quality and regardless of Trends in popularity doing what feels right to you because if it's truly something good that will speak for itself and this is a metaphor that we can apply to just about everything from people around us to situations we face and everything that we interact with like our favorite products hope you guys enjoyed this episode and if you like this format let us know what you would like to see below give it a like give it a thumbs up and if you've just joined the beauty within family thank you and more to come soon see you in the next one perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRc_4prBkzo&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,all right guys how many of you know asip the skin care brand from australia that's owned by a brazilian company called natura and co who also owns the body shop and avon do you know this house do you know their fragrances well today i'm going to review four of their fragrances called marrakesh intense tacket or tacit hawaii and rosu their latest fragrance which just launched a few months ago so if you're curious to learn about this house and their fragrances then please stay tuned [Music] thanks so much for tuning in this is sebastian with smelling great fragrance reviews that's right today i'm talking about asip an australian luxury skincare brand and i first discovered this brand way back in probably 2014 when i started going to barneys to buy perfumes well i went to barney's prior to that obviously but i wasn't really digging into skin care until much later but i really enjoyed the the whole you know the idea of the brand their quality and all their scents in their products and the fragrances i recently got into more recently than late and i've got all four of them now as i said it's marrakech intense tacit hawaiial and rozu hawaii would have ended up perfectly on my incense video recently but i didn't have it at the time i just recently picked it up so we're going to find out about these four fragrances but before i get to the fragrances if this is your first time tuning in to my channel and you still haven't subscribed please do click the subscribe button below and also click the bell so you'll be notified for future videos and giveaways so a lot of you have been asking me to cover this brand and finally have all four of their fragrances uh and now it's time for me to cover them and of course you guys have asked me uh about specific fragrances from the the house and not a lot of people talk about the fragrances from this house and i figured you know what it's time that we discuss them there's some great fragrances here and they are um you know there's still mass fragrances but they are a little on the edgy side they're not like you know your typical department store fragrances where everybody or every fragrance smells similar there's some unique things here they're more indeed to me they they act a little more indie-esque uh indie-esque niche like indie houses so their fragrances seem to seem like that in comparison to uh their other brands the body shop which are very mass i believe uh from what i've sampled in the past so this is different definitely and i'm not too experienced with avon so it's been a long time since i've smelled anything avon but this brand i think it totally stands out next to the body shop and the body shop is a skincare brand as well so let's go ahead and talk about marrakesh intense first i want to show you how the fragrances come now these are a little uh i ordered a mail order uh and a little they're a little scuffed up they come in little boxes like this and each fragrance has a different price all four fragrances three of them are eau de parfum concentration the very first one i'm going to talk to you about is marrakech intense it's eau de toilette concentration and as i said all four have different prices this marrakesh intense is the least expensive it's 50 ml and it's 95 dollars auto toilet as i said and this fragrance to me is more woodsy spicy with slightly floral nuances and it's inspired by something you would smell in the spice markets of marrakech that's why it's called marrakech intense but i was also doing some research and i said i noticed that on their website asip's website it said that they're inspired by culinary adventures of the spice markets so you know this is actually really uh spicy but also it's uh i was thinking i would name drop like something like tower perfumes layer to desert maro cane they're not at all similar except for the fact that this is spicy just like that what i like about this one that uh the cardamom stands out a lot but everything in here connected together has a very fizzy almost like coca-cola kind of a vibe which actually is fun uh soda fragrances are fun and there is something in the background that acts like it's bubbling uh like a can of coke that you've poured into a cup and it's fizzing everywhere i like that part of uh this fragrance is it really reminding me of the spice markets in market well i've never been to marrakech i've always wanted to go but i can smell the spices in here and i think what's causing that um fizzy quality is the cloves with the bergamot at the top notes which is really really wonderful i really love it so if you like spicy fragrances i recommend this this that's how the bottle is right here and the packaging for uh asip's marrakech intense again there are smaller bottles they're easy to transport they're a little heavy uh the glass i feel like is definitely a really strong glass so if it falls it might not break but don't take my word on that one but marrakesh intense is fun it's a fun fragrance and i like that whole coca-cola fizziness inside you can see some very interesting writing but recently i picked up hawaii this is it right here from a local san francisco shop aesop shop and they're not cellophane wrapped so i think that's how the fragrances are handed and i ordered the other three that i'm talking about including marrakesh intense so marrakesh intense tacit and rozu were mail ordered uh they came like this that's quite a little they're a little scuffed because the shipping kind of ruined them because they're not cellophane wrapped so this one's the 95 one the least expensive one and also the eau de toilette one the rest of them are eau de parfum so if you like spicy fragrances they're a little on the playful side because of this whole fizzy vibe that i get from marrakech intense you should check out this one um i like it it's a great fragrance actually um they're not overly strong the fragrances are more subtle they're not like loud beasts or anything like that so i think the best way to experience these fragrances is to get some samples if you can or go to an asip store and sample there as i said here we had barney's it's no longer here but in san francisco i think there's two or three ace of skin care stores that i can go to and you know sample their skin care products or body products and then of course smell their fragrances and there's a total of four so the second fragrance i'm going to talk to you about today is tacit which is here so this is slightly higher priced it's 125 for a 50 ml but it's also an eau de parfum concentration fragrance and again it's not cellophane wrapped and this is what the inside looks like and the bottle is similar brownish color but seems a little on the greener side in comparison to marrakesh intense i should not have put although they're the same color as you can see so tacit some so i noticed that on their website it says this is a uh modern take on a classic cologne so it uses a lot of citruses it's green it's bitter it's citrusy it's fresh woody and spicy so those are all uh key words or accords i guess i should say that come to mind with this one but at the top there's loads of citruses and yuzu yuzu fruit and yuzu is like grapefruit so there's this bitterness about it there's a zinginess about it but it's also um causing a little bit of subduedness i i find that a lot of the fragrances in this collection they're not screamers so if you don't like screamers then these probably are ones that you would like if you do like screamers these might not be ones that you should try there anytime i experience fragrances that are a little subdued a little more quiet there's some classiness around them uh there's some i don't want to use the word sophisticated but whenever fragrance screams like loud beasts things like that i would never call those fragrances classy because they're just overwhelmingly strong and um you know class goes with the subtleties for me and i just think that anytime that fragrances have the subtleness about it then i can you know call it a classy fragrance and this one definitely has it um one thing i forgot to mention all their fragrances are unisex gender neutral it says on their website and once again this one also has um cloves and i've noticed that their fragrances all three except for marrakesh intense has vetiver so the vetiver deodorant obviously uh from this house is something that i really enjoy it is pricey it's really dark earthy and smoky and i feel like they complement the three fragrances and i think they should also complement marrakesh intense as well because i think it would work it would just add a smoky layer to that fragrance which i think might be missing because seems very bright for marrakesh intense for spices and things like that definitely i think it needs a little uh smokiness but going back to tacit um if you like the bitterness of colognes if you like them spicy woody of uh like traditional odor colognes or uh fragrances that are inspired by you know citrusy odor colognes this might be one for you to try the clothes there's clothes again in here and there's clothes in the other fragrance as well so it seems like some notes they do like to use over and over again now i wasn't able to find the details of who the perfumers are on these fragrances so i don't really know but i'm actually digging a lot of these fragrances if i want some less i guess if i want some subtle more subtle fragrances i would go with the fragrances from this but yeah i can see the whole um citrus uh oda cologne or cologne inspired qualities of this fragrance but it does have a little more of a dense oomph woodsyness and spiciness about it so that's tacit with an interesting name um their names are pretty interesting here tacit and uh hawaii uh which is the next fragrance we're gonna talk about are pretty interesting rozu kind of gives me a hint of what i'm going to smell rose rosu and marrakech spa intense i i think is a fairly straightforward name so that's tacit once again this is a 50 ml 125 not the most expensive the last fragrance is the most expensive and we're going up in price every time we do a fragrance in this collection so the cheapest is the marrakesh intense so this is the newest fragrance i just recently picked it up from one of our asap locations here in san francisco and this is called hawaii h-w-y-l i don't know this name i didn't do research on the name pretty interesting name almost reminds me of highway or hawaii hawaii or whatever it doesn't matter uh i don't know how it also matches the the fragrance because it's a smoky woody japanese forest incense inspired fragrance and that's why i said this would have been perfect in my instance fragrances video but it also reminds me of con de garcons uh inspired in scentsy kind of woodsy fragrances so hawaii is a 2017 launch i didn't say the dates on the other fragrances today marrakesh intense was 2014 um tacit was 2015 in hawaii is 2017. odapar femme 50ml 135. so this one actually has lots of greenish touches inside the box here i like it it's almost like green lilies or something i don't know what that image has anything to do with the fragrance but once again the same color similar color bottle as you can see if i can get all three up here but yeah they're the same color although this one seems a little yellower so hawaii is a smoky woody rich green dark forest incense and totally reminds totally reminds me of incense fragrances or woodsy incense-y fragrances or smoky fragrances from the com de garcon so i can see that this might be inspired by those fragrances but then again i don't know um it's definitely green and it's a kind of incense japanese incense to me like kyoto from the garcon cdg incense series there is something more balanced about it it's not like ultra smoky and also burned it smells a little more green and woodsy and this actually captures that very well with this one at the top you've got lots of spices like thyme and other spices well thyme is an herb obviously but other spices so there's a spicy start aromatic herbal start and then the cypress comes in now i don't know if it's a cypress like traditional western cypress or if it's like hanoki which is a japanese cypress i believe and then there's also more woods and then in the base notes is the olive and that gives it the smoky incense-y touch with vetiver oak moss there's a vetiver again and i like this one a lot it's definitely easy to wear incense because it's not all about the incense there's the spices the aromatic touches and then also the wood so all of it is nicely blended together and for a dark smoky incensie ex woody experience definitely the green comes into mind too uh it has lots of green touches so that's hawaii let me know if you guys are fans of this because this one seems to get a lot of um i mean what i'm about to say is like people comment and mention this particular fragrance that they're fans of so i can see that it's pretty popular maybe it's the most popular from the collection that's why i wasn't able to buy all four of them together i had to buy this one locally from our uh asap store here in san francisco anyway a while 135 for a 50 ml launched in 2017 and the last fragrance here the one i experienced the most because i've been wearing this for the longest because i really love it is rosu so 20 20 launch 50ml 180. now this one's really really expensive not sure what happened with this one maybe it's the notes they're using so row zoo you can kind of tell from the color it's a rosy pinkish purplish red as far as the box goes it seems like there's woods on it and green leaves but obviously it's in black and white so with this particular fragrance for me it hints at a little bit of a little bit le labo's uh rose 31 so it's a kind of a spicy rose earthy bitter green definitely lots of spices and lots of green stems you can kind of smell the stems the rose stems when you chop them or cut them to put in a voss there's a smell you definitely pick it up here but it does have oh i think it does have a little bit of cumin and that's kind of why it reminds me a little bit of rose 31. they're not identical though don't worry but i think what's giving me that kind of green stemmy uh smell is the shiso there's shiso in the notes but this one again it's floral it's green woody and spicy and there's some light smoky touches in here as well top notes are rosebud bitter orange bergamot shiso and pink pepper and i think that originally that when you first spray it you get that kind of green stemmy quality that rose stems have rose ylang yulong jasmine and gayak wood in the heart and i think the gayak wood must be this right there finally in the base notes there are some smoky resonance touches in the musk patchouli myrrh sandalwood and vetiver vetiver comes again and i think rose 31 also has vetiver but for me rose 31 is not so stemi i don't have that shiso uh a kind of greenish slightly stemmy a green stemmy kind of a smell definitely not present in rose 31 it is here but i think the there's a coumany undertone in here it doesn't mention cumin but something maybe is causing that kumini kind of smell that you know some kind of an accord but the vetiver definitely is prominent here that's also in rose 31 and of course the roses in here but this is really really great it's quite sexy because of the kumini touches i quite like it and again it's not like a full jammy rose it's just a dry kind of um it's just almost like a like the life span of a rose because it's you go when you first smell a rose it doesn't have a lot of smell you smell the greenness when it hasn't opened up and then as it's developing it's getting sweeter and sweeter and more you know jammy and things like that so you have the whole entire experience here with this fragrance and that's what i like about it it's kind of like a rose journey but it's not a full-on in your face rose but great scent the most expensive unfortunately 180 for a 50 ml eau de parfum and 2020 launch so this is rozu from the house of asip so those are the four fragrances from asap i wanted to do this video as you guys have been asking me and finally it's done and let me know what your thoughts are on this house do you use their skin care i mean have you tried any of their skin care because i've tried some and they're pretty interesting i don't really uh i guess i should say i'm not really like a skin care person i don't do a lot i should to make me look younger maybe but as far as the fragrances are concerned these are great but of course their deodorant the vetiver deodorant is awesome you should check it out and some of their products i have used here and there and i think they're also great so i should definitely look into using them but anyway those are my thoughts on the four fragrances from asip marrakesh intense tacit or is it tackett hawaii and rozu if you're fans of these fragrances or that house for their skincare or body care please let me know put some comments down also which one sounds great to you if you've never tried them because i'd like to find out after hearing me talk about the fragrances which one would you check out first anyway guys thanks so much for watching today if you have any questions or comments please list below otherwise please like this video please share it follow me on facebook twitter and instagram and i'll be back with more videos very soon have a good one goodbye [Music] you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VreXcokCJI4&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,oh man oh man oh we need to invent smell-o-vision hey it's Jess Rose welcome to this unboxing for the ESOP Aesop usop you stop by soap I don't know is it an ESO I think it's ESOP as in esop's fables everybody says Aesop Aesop's favorite is a a sub but I think the little squiggly thing makes it an e if you know let me know in the comments but do it phonetically don't just put oh it's Aesop because then we're like well yeah but how do you say anyway esophageal use up YouTube I can't do that every time I'm gonna stick with one Aesop two incredible Aesop products one I've never used before the geranium Leaf body cleanser basically you can use it as a shower gel I'm going to explain why in a second we're doing that and the other one is the resurrection aromatic hand bomb to you and I hand lotion or moisturizer let's have a little look they arrive today um I'm a big fan of esoc products uh partly the naturalness I like the really slightly more refined uh unusual smell that they have there's like a really lovely depth to their scents it's a great brand the products are incredible quality they are on the pricier side now I travel an awful lot I'm in the garden an awful lot I'm using my hands a lawful lot but also my hands appear on camera and my hands up here you know if I'm doing magic or something then certainly uh very close to people so I look after my hands as much as I possibly can I don't have the nicest hands in the world but I moisturize them often and this moisturizer we're going to talk about today the moisture as they call it the hand balm is out of this world it is knock out one of the best hand bombs um I've ever used I've never really spent much time with the cleansing products we've had ESOP hand wash and hand lotion before and that's utterly glorious as well and definitely a bit of a treat because it is quite pricey but this geranium Leaf body cleanser sounded amazing so um the really cool thing about ESOP is the detail and the attention to detail when you order online you get a really lots of kind of cute messages and well thought through uh communication I knew this would happen I don't think I've ever bought from ESOP directly before online but look at that the inside of the Box even has this is the flap that came out here so then on the outside of the box there's nothing and the closer you get to the product the more sort of teased you get so you get ease up logo here there's a little description about um the ESOP was established in Melbourne in 1987. we're nearly the same age happy birthday um objective has always been to formulate products with a finance quality blah blah blah blah blah you can read up on that yourself so if you say when you order online that this is a gift they arrive in this really cute uh we're done with that ESOP sort of Hessian bag which I think is quite a nice little touch so particularly nice I did this just for the unboxing it's not a gift I wouldn't normally uh do that but I think that's a really nice touch if you are going to gift it on you can fold this up you know wrap it in tons of tissue paper and stuff so that when they oops when they unwrap the tissue paper and the box that you presented with them yeah you have that which is really nice so inside the little bag we're going to start with the body cleanser because I've never used it before classic iconic styling these uh plastic ESOP brown bottles with this sort of almost uh clinical almost pharmaceutical sort of labeling now this is the geranium Leaf body cleanser which I'm gonna use as a shower gel for a little bit so I really really really love a shower if I've been in the garden all day if I've been traveling I love coming home having a hot shower just feeling fresh again this has geranium Leaf Mandarin rind and Bergamot rind in it so it's going to be an interesting smell aromatic body cleansing gel for all skin types this is the other cool thing about ESOP is most of their products are really good for sensitive skin um most of my body skins okay I have sort of sensitive face a little bit I've got a dry skin but this is a fabulous alternative to regular soap enhanced with geranium leaf extract to cleanse without drying the Skin So ideal actually for the shower usual thing this is sort of a standard pump bottle really I don't think I need to talk about that very much this is a 500 mL bottle um and you know actually you only need a tiny amount with all of the um ESOP um uh products I do so wince a little bit when I watch other people like like pumping and plunging the stuff on it's just a waste a waste of money and a waste of product you really don't need that much I'm just gonna have a quickly look on my computer here to remind me that's right okay so this is 500 mil body wash it's 35 pounds for this bottle by far not the cheapest product you will buy but it's also by far not the most expensive and I have found with ESOP so this is a really nice kind of a slightly jealous consistency which means it's going to go further oh man oh man oh we need to invent smell-o-vision ah that is fresh it is vibrant it's nature oh gosh it is um this is I cannot wait to shower we should do an addition of this where I'm in the shower and you can you can guys can come with me and it's a pass from me I've just realized what I've said that's absolutely not do that that clearly is not going to happen but you can think about it maybe I don't know maybe that doesn't help either um you can be going okay we're not buying it it's a bit leaked out here so it is it's it's green but it's fresh it's it's yellow and orange it's floral it's you can definitely smell a bit of the Bergamot but also the geranium this is absolutely the shower gel you know how there's that shower gel that if you're washing it and it's a little bit oh oh tingly but it's fresh Rosemary is great for for a shower as well in the morning just sort of wakes you up but I don't want something that's like hey wake up we're alive let's go and clean I don't want that I want to kind of hey hey we're ready to start waking up Punchy let's kind of brighten up slowly but here's something fresh and oh here's something that's what I want in the shower right I don't want to be assaulted in a shower that is you know by somebody screaming at me like a military Sergeant to wake up what but this I can't wait to shower on it it's a really really good smell it doesn't smell chemically it doesn't smell um artificial that's a really good natural naturey smell I would uh highly recommend this this is going to be gorgeous I would imagine with like all of the ESOP products it's going to linger as well um it's really sad isn't it it's a bit like herbal tea smells great but somebody recently said to me it's like eating wood it's just like a sucking on a stick it doesn't taste anything like it smells like really nice thing about most of ESOP products is actually it lingers for a bit you know you can sort of smell it on your hand so I'd imagine if you're washing your body in that you're going to feel fresh and alive and a little bit more waking up after it so uh lovely lovely if it's like the rest of it 10 out of 10 I um I highly recommend that so the second part of this unboxing today is for this other product I bought which I've used tons it is my favorite hand cream it's the resurrection aromatic hand balm which comes in this kind of metal tube very much like an oil paint you'd expect to come in this kind of metal tube it's even got the little rolled in there the ESOP products remind me a little bit particularly when they you know the these uh brands of the sort of line of them sorry remind me of uh product packaging that maybe people would have had years ago you know like Matisse and uh Vermeer and people like that that were painting amazing painting Michelangelo you know in something maybe probably not a tool like this this is really commercial that's too late this is more like Dali and uh people like that maybe so it's quite small this is a hundred no it's 75 mil which is why I like it because it fits in my travel bag for traveling and your hands where your skin generally suffers a lot when you're traveling right it dries out and it gets cracked and chipped and then of course if you it dries out you get the kind of cracks in your um your cuticles and they split and that really hurts and your nails aren't in great condition and you know you're touching stuff and handling stuff and moving stuff around when you travel so I often find that with dry hands I just kind of feel um I don't know I type a lot I write a lot with a pen I you know obviously I perform a lot so my hands are quite important to me and I use them a lot in the garden so they do get abused quite a bit so I tried to look after them as it almost as a thank you to my hands for allowing me to be hands and pick stuff up and do stuff now I have been through I mean forever I went through a phase of I mean it went on for years years five six maybe more years buying all sorts any moisturizer I could get my hands on to see literally to see whether it was you know too greasy too milky too watery too smelly not smelly enough not moisturizing enough um this this is knockout this is incredible but it is also quite expensive I like money um I find that all of the ESOP products are quite pricey and it does out price them for some people this is 25 pounds for this 75 mil um I know I know we're all different uh but I think it's worth it this has Mandarin rind just like the other product we just reviewed rosemary leaf and Cedar Atlas I have no idea what Cedar Atlas is but it seems to be the magic ingredient it's like a kind of Woody smell so it is just like a tube of tomato puree in so much that you get a sealed end of that if I do that here you might be able to see it maybe that's irrelevant a camera's going why do we need to see that so it's sealed which is nice so you can sort of double check when you open it on something tampered with the end of the lid has that little kind of you know sharp in it he just literally reverse pop the lid in there you can see that's come out there and then you get this ah it's just so difficult to explain this it is it's a unique smell it's a pleasant smell this is the kind of consistency it is almost a bit like painting actually it's um it's not really runny you can see it kind of it's not running anywhere but it's not super super thick so if I move this around a bit on my palm you'll kind of see the consistency of it right and it's it doesn't feel greasy on your skin there is a can definitely some other Mandarin rind and I think you can smell that cedar Atlas whatever the hell that is I had an outlet at school it was a World Atlas not a sealer at this it's not relevant is it um it's got this it's slightly kind of um creamy almondy kind of uh color to it it's not it's not white uh you can see that and so when you move it in that's just a couple of times right you see how quickly that is I don't have very dry hands today at all but you can see how kind of quickly that gets absorbed and this very very quickly I find this all the time even if my hands aren't dry if I go like a second time round it it um absorbs into your hands really really quickly you see that and that's what I like about it I always do my fingernails as well other cuticles because they dry out really quick um you find that with some hand creams you spend forever rubbing it in or that you know going over it doesn't just doesn't absorb very well I've always found that ESOP hand cream does brilliantly and what's really I mean now they don't feel dry dry but they don't feel slimy and greasy like you can feel it that's in but I would feel comfortable picking anything up right now and there's this I don't know it's quite a it's a mature it's not this is a really difficult thing to say particularly now because I want to offend anybody but it's quite a it's not a feminine smell it's not it's not too flowery it's not too uh that kind of sweet or floral it's it's a woody it's kind of unisexy smell right you know it's not if you want something that smells very pretty this isn't that product if you want something that um will sort of you know slip under the radar or smell sort of a bit sort of I don't know intelligent how does the smell smell intelligent it smells um yeah good it's it's kind of Deep bit Woody but there's a sort of citrus sort of pop in there um and if you you know just kind of wafting your hands around I can't smell it and I really like that because what I don't like is when you sort of put hand cream on and then you can kind of smell it everywhere and it's just like what is that sort of you know they've all got that sort of florally sweetie smell and this is it's a really really it's great 10 out of 10. it's a really really great product really handy size and I like the fact that it's uh natural ingredients too so I'm going to very quickly cover that off because I know from other conversations that I have with people that's really important first ingredients water uh glycerin it doesn't have um it's got sweet almond oil in it it doesn't have any of the nasties in it I'm just double checking this before I absolutely should have put my glasses on for this because it's really tiny as well um oh see Atlas Cedar is Cedar Wood oh there we go bar coil oh from the Cedarwood gotcha um yeah this is lovely orange oil it's all natural lovely stuff carrot lemon oil okay so there's a couple of the sort of the normal things you'd expect to find if you're trying to avoid limonene or linolu um then avoid this but other than that it's all really gorgeous stuff got nut derivatives in it that's the only problem so obviously if you have nut allergies or your um you have concerns about using nuts maybe for other people in your family or colleagues then avoid it so those are my ESOP reviews this week unboxing for the resurrection aromatic hand balm and the geranium Leaf body cleanser both of which I think you should roll around in in utter Joy like a squirrel in a huge bowl of walnuts I'll see you next time foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRwhteRhe0&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,have you ever wondered are asap products worth it well i've tested a few and here are the three asap products that i think are worth buying let's begin with the parsley seed facial cleansing oil i've been using this for years and i love it because it cleanses without dehydrating and leaves your face feeling perfectly refreshed the ingredients feature a medley of oils from nuts and seeds including macadamia nut sunflower seed and parsley seed to use i apply three to four drops directly to my face massage massage massage and then i rinse it all off with warm water next up is the lucent facial concentrate this one is my holy grail product i use it as a serum so i apply it after cleansing and toning and before moisturizer i love it because it smooths out my pores and adds a natural dewy glow to my skin it smells of light roses and is infused with vitamin c and b3 for a full breakdown of its ingredients i found this wonderful website that breaks down each ingredient into easy non-scientific terms which i will leave in the description box for those who are interested and finally we have the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i first bought this because an aesop store associate told me that the loosened facial concentrate is best paired with the parsley seed antioxidant facial hydrating cream i love it because it is super hydrating and protects against environmental aggressors the only con is that it is rather fragrant so i would recommend this for those who have sensitivity to fragrance it is full of hydrating ingredients such as aloe vera leaf gel sweet almond oil and shea butter although a full breakdown of its ingredients will also be in the description box below and that wraps up my list at least so far of asap products worth buying i have been using these products for at least two years now and they're still my favorites so i think that's saying a lot though if you have any questions feel free to pop them in the comments below [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxcWXCdFeJY&t=1s&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,hey guys and welcome back to mad Mouse skin if you're new to our Channel welcome here at Mad Max game weren't passionate about helping you to get the most out of your skin care so if you haven't already now it's a fantastic time to click that link below and subscribe to the channel ring the notification bell and you won't miss out many of our amazing future content today's video will be doing a full brand review in this series we look at the best the worst within the brand we take the whole brand apart we look at each individual product the good the bad the pros the cons what you need to spend your money on and any products that you just need to avoid today we are talking about this brand Aesop it is an Australian brand they're fabulous because most of their products are vegan they are cruelty free they have a great environmental sustainability record and they look beautiful they hit the shelves around the time that Instagram became a huge thing at the timing for this company was perfect because this is the most Instagram of all packaging ever it became a design sensation they started the utilitarian style of packaging just went mad and a stop of the first to really come on board with that most people buy it because I like the packaging they couldn't care less what's in the bottle I am a huge believer that you have to be drawn to a product the product has to look good I also think that the packaging has to reflect the quality of packages should reflect the quality of the products inside I won't buy something just because of the packaging that's a lie I have bought things just because the packaging but you shouldn't do as I say not as I do do not buy things just because the packaging okay we're gonna get into this and we're gonna work out whether the products inside are as gorgeous as the packaging on the outside we're not gonna go in any particular order unlike pixie which was the last one we did I'll link the video of that where there was like 36 different products a sub only have six skin care specific products they do have extra ones they have mouthwashes toothpaste shampoos I'm just dealing with the things that go on the skin so we're gonna tackle those in this video and we're gonna go into the lipid detail about each one and work out whether you need the product in your life or you don't straight off the bat I'd love you to know have you tried these products you heard of it do you like the look of it leave me a comment below I'd love to know your thoughts and let's get into it so first of all is this this is the rose by any other name body cleanser now you know something's expensive when it's called a cleanser not a wash but this is basically a shower it smells heavenly I don't usually like the smell of rose but they've mixed it with cardamom and black pepper so it's kind of like a Middle East and Rosie smokes like dark and yet still quite floral it is a beautiful scent well this is I say it is genuinely unisex I mean I hate gendered fragrances I mean if you like I sent you like a scent it rings as a matter on your agenda but this is a genuine unisex episode I think anybody could love if you have this in your shower you will look the part you will smell the part and the whole bathroom after you've used it smells of that sort of dark rose it's just a very exotic very expensive snowing product I love it 22 pounds here in the UK not sure on the pricing in the US but give it a Google I think it'll be around the $30 point do I think you need to spend $30 on a body wash no just do I keep repurchasing this absolutely someone bought me this as a gift for Christmas thinking I love the packaging and didn't think that I actually usually quite hate the smell of rose but I love it i'm not like bottle 3 and this is now my go to body wash sensational stunning gorgeous worth worth money and some people might say you does have a mess or sodium lauryl sulfate in there which should be quite drying I don't think that's an issue most body wash does it what matters there it creates that lather I think that's absolutely fine for most people if you have very dry skin eczema dermatitis then obviously you know the drill you don't want to give me this product but I think on the body it's absolutely fine different issue when it comes to the face but I don't think there's any problem with that people with normal and skin with it with that doesn't have a compromised barrier function perfect I love that product similar product but slightly different so is that the parsley seed cleanser leave an image of it they're 27 pounds here in the UM in the UK $35 in the US I want to like this front I mean two minds about this product so I used it the smell is gorgeous it's again it's that sort of earthy herby but it's a beautiful beautiful scent it's got lactic acid in it which whilst I don't ever think you should have an active ingredient in your cleanser necessarily because you're putting it on and you're washing it off it's a nice to have it's got like to kassadin better than it not having that end and it smells gorgeous and really does hydrate the skin it's got a few minutes in there and it's one of the few cleansers I've used when I've washed it off foaming cleansers where I've washed it off I've not felt dry afterwards does have sodium lauryl sulfate and so it will be drying to some extent and anybody that has a compromised barrier function on the skin should avoid this product and is it going to be my go-to cleanser no I think it is I just don't like some of those ingredients the family I prefer a non foaming cleanser because I think you can just do away with the sodium lauryl sulfate you don't need it in your life it's only because you want this affecting quality that you end up with it in the product so it's not my go-to it is a nice product I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 because I think the smell is nice and it does leave your skin hydrated there's some pretty greedy insane there that don't think it necessary the packaging is gorgeous the delivery methods gorgeous a little goes a long way the prices were expensive overall I think it's good product and if you want to try one thing from a stop isn't the body wash I think this should be something you try I think you'll love the smell and I think as long as you haven't got a particularly dry complexion I think you absolutely love the product you think do very clearly marketed this on their website for drab for oily and combination oily skin so actually a lot of the a little bit of drying isn't a bad thing for people with those skin types so I think it's marketed correctly I do wish the doorway with some of those ingredients but I think it's marketed correctly the smell is gorgeous and the product is fantastic the lactic acid is just a nice extra nice to have will leave you hydrated and it doesn't dry too much God's product six out of ten now we're going to be a purifying pure let me get my words out purifying facial exfoliant paste believe that that again the packaging is spot-on looks like toothpaste it's innovative it's different this has a lactic acid in again most of the products are lactic acid based don't know why they've chosen like to cast it over like colic acid which is a standard but again is slightly different so it's giving you something that's slightly different my issue with this is it's got crushed quartz in it I don't I don't understand in this day I we have crushed metals kristan minerals crushed stones what is that all about it's too aggressive on the skin and you just don't need it in your life I would have loved them to learn a pace that was just lactic acid based and done away with that manual exfoliation which I think is damaging to the skin and can actually do more harm than good the products 35 pounds which is very expensive for a manual exfoliant it's a hard pass from me I don't think the course is adding anything other than potential irritation damage to the skin the lactic acid is should be enough on its own to deliver that I think they should reformulate this take out the course bump up the power of the lactic acid and they would have me as a buyer because again smell is lovely it is fragrance but again I think this is a theme of their products they do have that fragrance the fragrance is nice if you're sensitive this won't be for you anyway but no this is a firm pass I'm gonna give it a two out of ten they get the latch Cassidy is nice so they're getting a point for that it's cruelty free they get a point for that the rest just a hard pass I don't think you need this moving up to this product which is that fabulous facial oil 39 pounds right off the bat do you need to spend 39 pounds on the facial oil do you hack no I've done a whole video on drugstore facial oils which I'll link up there you can get them for $5 don't know why spending your money on this it's a beautiful combination of oils smell is heavenly and it's mixed together beautifully so it sticks into the skin it's not too greasy yeah it's still hydrating so it's ding-ding-ding when it comes to what it delivers I just think the price is too much for what is in fact available at the drugstore for five to ten dollars and the packaging is beautiful the delivery is beautiful all of that I can't take that away from them and the mix of oils is nice but fairly standard if this was 19 pounds rather than 39 I'd be saying give it a go worth the pun I think it's too expensive for what it is and what it delivers but it is a nice facial oil and again if you won't dip your toe if you want the aesthetic of having this beautiful packaging on your Basin and something you would actually use if you don't mind spending 40 pounds on a product this is a nice facial oil I'm giving it 6 out of 10 because again I'm knocking the points off of the price but the actual formulation is beautiful the mix of oils is really nice scent is really lovely and it does hydrate the skin without leaving it too greasy so from all that perspective it's great I just with the price is a little bit much for the actual combination of oils that you're getting if that make sense now moving to that antioxidant she's that past receipt antioxidant they love that past they seem to be mad for parsley it's one of their signature fragrances but it does smell lovely this antioxidant is fantastic plant extracts are great the chlorophyll in plants is packed full of antioxidants so anything that has plant mastery is going to be a powerful and fantastic antioxidant this is no exception and I love the formulation I adore adore the way it applies its serum is light you barely know you're wearing it it smells nice but it's a natural friggin again natural fragrances you can still be sensitive to but it is natural it's not synthetic so just be aware of that beautiful product honestly the lights on I would definitely definitely definitely recommend this if it wasn't for the 57 pounds price tag now if you have a little bit of extra cash and you want to treat yourself and you want to enjoy a product that's a little bougie a little extra you know you vent your money you deserve a treat this is a really good product I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 I love the antioxidant I love the way it's formulated I love the ingredients list I love the scent I loved it everything about it that look the scent and the packaging and the ingredients are spot-on the two points are coming off because of that price pub which i think is unobtainable odd I do need to spend that when you could get a much cheaper antioxidant doesn't mean you have to be cheap though you could spend your money on this and again if you want that beautiful aesthetic and you want to try a new product and you want to treat yourself this would be a fantastic product to do just that I love it finally we have the lightweight facial hydrating serum they really image of that there and this this is the firm pass I have it's expensive in the UK it's 48 pounds in the u.s. it's around the $60 point this is expensive and it is hyaluronic acid it is few order other adding a humectants it's a nice smell that is it you'd be better just getting the Neutrogena ahem moisturizer that I always rave on about the hydro boost is gorgeous you could get a matte the inky list they've just come out with vitamins A vitamin oyster Iser which is really nice similar consistency and yeah just a fraction of the price it's the price on this just puts me off it's a nice product there's nothing wrong with it but it's not delivering anything there's no active ingredients in there it's nothing beyond just hydrating facial serum lovely to use the scent is nice I just don't feel you need to spend that much money I don't think I could just if I recommend to get on that basis so that's it it's a short product line but an iconic one I think like I say it was a design a sensation and people have this if you look at any instrument it's so Instagram abort the search a stop on Instagram you'll see all the beautiful packaging and it'll make you want to buy it if you're bought if you're sold on the packaging and you want the lifestyle that goes with this product I would fully recommend you get the rose by any other name body cleanser beautiful in the shower his-and-hers perfect anybody can use it I love this it is just it wakes you up in the morning it makes you feel fabulous before you go to bed everything about it is lovely it basically makes your whole bathroom smell absolutely divine definitely would recommend that the fabulous base oil if you want to spend 40 pounds on the face oil is rid is a good product it's well formulated product and I would recommend it I just don't think you need to spend that money but as a treat you absolutely could fur passes for me and that the exfoliating pace that's actually potentially dangerous to the skin leave that forget the facial serum the hydrating facial serum it's doing nothing and the cheaper alternatives and parsley seed cleanse that yes if you're very oily and you're not worried about few drying ingredients for anyone else I think it'll just be a bit drying and a bit stripping for the skin guys I hope you've enjoyed this review I love this bra I mean I'm so tired I want to give this I want to say they could reformulate and do better but I love this product so I bought into the brand let me know your thoughts your comments I want to hear all about it give this video a thumbs up follow us on over an Instagram and I cannot wait to see you in the next video guys wherever you are take care of yourself and take care of one another take yeah bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFgcSNN46dc&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,oh god I've got so many spots Wow my skin is so greasy that forehead dandruff hello guys and welcome to sophisticated obsession on today's show we look at skincare brand a stop in particular we will then be discussing my skincare routine coming up it is Matt here from sophisticated obsession with another video for you guys so today we are going to be looking at skincare so at the start of the video maybe it is you that is saying one or two of those things when you look in the mirror and that your skin is just not doing what you wanted to do now today we are going to be discovering the brand ESOP and exactly what ISIL can do for your skin so ISIL is an Australian brand and it boasts of using really really natural products and remedies now I've got to say that just off the back from this I have had absolutely brilliant customer service from Aesop whether it is dealing online or whether it is actually going into a store they are so so generous when it comes to their samples and they seem to really really care about your skin I've been into a couple of the stores in London and each time I've been in London I have come out 100% satisfied so customer service seems to be a real major thing for this company likewise when I was dealing on the line I had a couple of problems because some of my items had been damaged on the delivery by email literally within 24 hours they got back to me and says no that's absolutely fine we're going to send you out a brand new pack they sent me everything so they are so so generous and I've got to say I absolutely love dealing with them let's look at their philosophy first of all cleanse cleaners basically means to clean the skin and you do this at the start of your skincare routine so it might be that you then you have a shower and then you do your cleansing after or if you are wanting to maybe do it on the other side of the day so if you take a shower in the morning then in the evening before you then apply your moisturizer you then want to then cleanse the skin to make sure that it hasn't got any impurities from the down this basically means that you have got them a blank canvas for your skin to work with number two tone tone basically means to ready the skin for hydration this just makes sure that your skin takes all of the moisture that is on offer to it number three hydration hydration fairly self-explanatory and probably the most well known out of these three elements it is basically putting on a moisturizer it is giving your skin moisture giving back to it making sure that your skin feels nourished rather than leathery now for my little disclaimer this is a product review that has worked for me on Aesop and I will put a link to their website just down below but on a stop they have loads and loads of products and most of which are not beneficial to me so today we are going to be looking through my skincare routine and then you can sort of take from that what elements you think will work for you and let's discard the rest so my skin type my skin type is what they call a combination skin type where I have slightly oily skin down my like my nose on my cheeks maybe around like where my my neckline is but then I've got really really dry skin when it comes to like my forehead my scalp I find that if I then apply too much moisture to my skin that will then make my skin really really greasy and also it can affect my hair if I apply to you less then I find that I get this weird of forehead dandruff thing going on it's not pleasant now I've recently found that I've had problems with my skincare I don't know if that it's because of my change blood location maybe if it's the change of weather that can that can have like in the FAQs or it might be that I'm just not drinking enough water all of those things could have an effect so let's get into it number one cleanse for cleanse I am using the parsley seed cleanser this cleanser comes with a pump just on top so you can then have an even distribution this is brilliant this is a breve product because it takes away all of that excess grime and all of the excess oil that's on your skin but it does not let your skin feel like paper and parchment so it doesn't dry out your skin it is important that after you have used this to then use a hydrating cream or an eye hydrating oil straight after all you need to do with this is take one pump then make a nice lava and apply onto your skin which is already damp just apply it and in just circle motions then just rub it into your skin leave it for a moment and then rinse number two toner so this is the parsley seed toner now this readies your skin ready for hydration this is brilliant this works as a really nice cleanser have enough time to then do the first process this works just as well however it isn't so much about nourishing clean as the actual cleanser this I find is really really nice just before bed it's awful Ivan's your skin and it makes it feel really really fresh now as you can see I have used absolutely loads of this because I use it at the start of my day and I also use it at the end of my day how do you apply this simply put a couple of drops upon your hands and then very gently just Pat this onto your skin you don't need to rub it and then just leave it to dry this should only take a few seconds number three hydration hydration is an interesting one because you then need to judge how your skin is feeling after those first two steps if my skin is feeling quiet nourished and it's feeling fairly hydrated but I just need a little pick-me-up I have been chosen the Mandarin facial hydrating cream now this cream is really really nice it's not too thick but it smells absolutely beautiful all you need to do is just apply a small amount onto your hand rub it and then in very small circle motions then just apply it to your face this product will leave your skin feeling really nourished but not overly thick so your skin can still have that breathable the fact this product will not make your skin feel extra thick and clumpy if I'm feeling like the manager and facial hydrating cream does not quite do it I can then combine this product with the cream is the damask and rose facial treatment now this can be applied on its own or it can be applied with another product and mixed in this oil now if your skin is oily don't worry Mike's my skin as I said before is is a combination so around my nose and around my my cheeks it can be quite oily with this it is absolutely fine this finishes in more like a matte finish so it's not gonna feel really greasy by the end of it all you need to do is apply three to five drops then just rub it ever so slightly on your hands and then apply to your face if you want to then combine it with another cream you could do so when you put your cream onto your hands combine it there and finally if my skin is feeling really thirsty and it's feeling really really tired I have then got the chameleon nut facial hydrating cream this is extra thing this is very nourishing and I would probably say that this cream you should be wearing before you go to bed I find that with this cream I can apply it before I go to work because it's too thick and I feel like my skin isn't really able to breathe that is when I would use my manager encourage just like a Mandarin hydration cream all you need to do is just apply a small amount onto your hammies rub it and then apply onto your face after your tone and cleanse routine the last products that I have is not for your face but for your hands and I absolutely love it this is the resurrection aromatic happened wash as it is basically the glorified soap it is but this is absolutely brilliant it makes your your hands feel so fresh so clean I mean this will get leach the dirtiest hands-free of Grimes these products are what I use on my day to day life there are absolutely loads of products in Aesop that might be perfect for you if you do have any questions about the products that I have then spoken about today or any products that they have online just

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxumeziuM1k&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,[Music] hey beautiful people haha hope you guys doing wonderful beauty to my channel welcome my name is Michelle and if you're one of my subscribers welcome back so I'm here today to share with you some products from the brand called ESOP I've talked about this brand over and over again because I stumbled across the store and I fell in love Etha is an Australian brand and they make skin care products hair care products products for your household and I would consider it to be luxury skincare the reason why I love ESOP products is because I'm really into sensory skin care I love my skin care items to have a pleasant aroma to give me an aromatherapy kind of feeling while using it my skincare ritual is really luxurious very relaxing it's my time to kind of pamper myself at the beginning and at the end of my day so I do tend to gravitate towards products that are mostly natural have a really nice aroma and perform well for my skin so ESOP does all of those things and today I have 13 products to share with you guys but if there's something that I don't touch upon feel free to leave a comment below so let's get started this first product I have is called the resurrection aromatic hand wash and it has mandarin lined rosemary leaf and cedar atlas inside of it this is a hand soap and I have it in 16.9 food ounces when I first visited the ESOP store in Santa Monica California they told me that this was one of their best-selling products and when I saw people walking in the store they kept picking this up I did not pick it up at first because I truly could not see myself spending that kind of money on hand pills but as I fell in love with the brand I truly do believe that their products are high performing and honestly they are just so aesthetically pleasing in my bathroom the way the soap sits next to the mouthwash and I'll talk about everything just kind of comes together the silk works well it works like soap I'm not really that big on hand so I could go buy something from Bath and Body Works and I'm good with that so to me it works well it smells good but it's just passable tow in my opinion I didn't see anything that was super special about this product other than the fact that it smells really nice and it looks really good the next test I have is the ESOP mouthwash and it has close and nice and spearmint leaf in it this is a regular mouthwash to help you clear any kind of bad breath or anything going on with your mouth I love this mouthwash first of all look at how beautiful it is you see like just the jar the start is glad but I do think they sell some that are just like in a regular bottle I love this top this little beaker top it so freaking cute you just pour the mouthwash in you drink it and your mouth is super happy and it's super happy because this mouthwash does not burn your mouth at all it's really smooth and a lot of people have tried this mouthwash out when they came to visit me and they've always made a comment about it afterwards saying that it was kind of weird the reason that they felt like it was weird was because it doesn't have that like really sinking feeling that Listerine gives you it feels like it very much could just be even water but it has that really nice spearmint taste at the end and it does do the job as far as like clearing your bad breath but if you're into like that stinging feeling that Listerine gives you you're not going to get that with it I really like it I've purchased it twice I do think it's really expensive from not blush but once you use this mouthwash you're not going to feel comfortable using anything else if you do go in the store to purchase it make sure that you asked for the little top because they don't just give it to you you have to actually ask for it and the last home product that I have are de stop post who dropped it has tangerine peel ylang-ylang mandarin peel in it and it smells amazing when I first saw this product I was like um I don't know about this but someone in the store told me that she gave it out to people as housewarming gifts and everyone loved it and what they are are drops just a freshen up of the bathroom it has a dropper on it and how I use it is I just put a couple drops in the toilet and a couple drops in the sink whenever I feel like it the whole bathroom smells so good it's amazing how concentrated it is because just a couple drops gives the bathroom this really early sweet aromatic scent it smells wonderful this is something that I will continue to repurchase it's not extremely long-lasting but it does linger for about an hour or so and if you're really into kind of like the sensory experience when you're doing your skincare regimen you could even put a couple of drops in the sink before you wash your face in the morning and you can just kind of breathe and take in the aroma while you're washing your face I promise you can fall in love this next product is the resurrection aromatic candle and this is just a hand balm it's a hand cream I've heard so much about the ESOP hand creams it seems like most people who are introduced to Esau it's kind of like their go-to product is their hand ball so I really did have high expectations for it I plan to use it as a hand lotion and as a foot lotion and I love the way this smells oh my goodness it smells so good the cream is yellow it's like a really thick yellow cream the consistency of it is pretty thick I love it as a hand lotion I think it works really well it's very creamy very moisturizing and it smells so good guys oh my goodness I love the way this smells it has the same smells of soap because they're both the resurrection so you can buy them together but whatever you purchase it know for the price point I can find much more reasonable hand balms to do the job I wanted to also use it I guess an all-over body lotion because of the way it smells but honestly it's just too expensive for that it's only 2.6 ounces so there's not that much in it and I feel like with my body I could probably finish it up in two to three uses but as a hand cream and a foot cream it's very very good after you use it on your hands your hands don't feel greasy or sticky it does moisturize so it does sink into your skin but like I said there's no like greasy residue the next part I have is the parsley seed facial cleansing oil and this has macadamia seeds to suffer all beta-carotene in it and it's a mild facial cleanser but suited for dry combination and sensitive skin I will be doing a skincare video where I show you all my skin care products and I'm also going to do a video that specifically looks at oil cleansers and this is an oil cleanser one thing I just want to point out that I love about Usopp is that just love the packaging you guys the glass on it is so nice I love the darkness of the bottles it kind of looks like a medicine bottle people make comments about that looks kind of like old-school medicine I think it's beautiful it fits the aesthetic of my home I just love the fact that I can sit it out and it looks like it could be decor I think that's just oh I love that so back to the product this is a oil cleanser it's very very thick this was my go-to cleanser in the winter time because of how moisturizing it is in the morning when I wake up I don't like my skin to feel like it's stripped because I have a whole nighttime regimen for my skin in the morning my skin looks really supple it looks really fresh and I don't like to just take away all of that so I do like products that are really moisturizing even though I have combination skin I do get oily in the t-zone I still like products that are really moisturizing this works really well but let me tell you do not put it on wet skin your face needs to be dry you just take a couple drops and you mix it in with a little bit of water just a tiny bit of water couple drops and rub it through your hands you put on your face and it does turn into an oil it does take off your makeup I would double cleanse with this I like to use this and follow it up with another cleanser if I have makeup on but if I'm using it in the morning first thing when I wake up I don't need to double cleanse this is enough I do think it's a wonderful product I would definitely repurchase this the only thing that I will say is at the top of it broke off so I just hope that they do a better job of making sure things like this are taken care of because it is a luxury product you're spending a lot of money so I would expect things to be intact this next product is my staple bass Lodge and I love it I love it it's the part sleeping facial cleanser and black currant seed and it's a gentle cleanser with a rich lather that's supposed to be good for all skin types and it does have mild exfoliation because it does have left an accident it it also does have some hellhole the oil in it three words for you guys love this cleanser this cleanser is my favorite and by the way if you purchase the cleansers make sure you ask for the pump it does not come with a pump top you need to ask for it this cleanser is super moisturizing and it's very thick it's not runny at all it's a really thick thick thick moisturizer my skin always feels very supple after using this but it does feel like it's cleansed and I love using this to mix with other brands that have exfoliators like powdered exfoliators I love mixing it together but I love this for cleaning my face it is more so geared towards people who have drier skin because it's so moisturizing if you have really oily skin I probably would recommend this it's very gentle only thing I don't like about this product is that when my hands are wet it doesn't so most nicely my face can be wet but my hands needs to be dry when I could to slope on my hands or else it won't lather up so that's something that I kind of wish was different because it is annoying but it works really well with Clarisonic or any kind of facial brush it works really well with that you just put a couple of pumps and it lathers like crazy so this is something that's holy grail for me I'll definitely repurchase it this next part is the purifying facial exfoliant paste and this is a facial exfoliator it's very mild it removes impurities on the skin it has five quarts rosemary and lactic acid in it as well I am obsessed with this this is my favorite facial exfoliator ever the product is white but it does have these little beads in it to exfoliate your face with but they're not harsh at all the smell of this is really weird I didn't particularly like smell of this it kind of smells like food to me and not food that I like it doesn't smell good at all in my opinion it does not worthy that maybe the rosemary in its giving it that smell and not a fan of the rosemary smell so it's probably that but this product works so well it takes off all the dead skin off my face my face isn't still dry after using it my face feels renewed so I love love love this exfoliator I use it maybe once a week if I remember my skincare it just you know it's I listen to my skin so if my skin needs to be exfoliated if it feels like a lot of gunk on it and it feels like it's really dirty just reset it for me so I love this product the six-pack is a face mask and it's called the blue calomel facial hydrating mask it has Nia sediment so the encouragin and visible in it and it supposed to be a hydrating facial mask to refresh soft it and replenish normal to dry skin so it was interesting for a facial mask to be in a little pump like this that was different usually the masks are like in jars but I have talked about this mask a lot in a lot of different videos this is one of my hands-down favorite moisturizing mask it's really hard to find a really good moisturizing face mask this is very very very potent it's very potent you only need a little bit and you just kind of put it onto your face it's clear as soon as you put it onto your face you will feel it's kind of stinging it you can tell something is working there's something going on with it and I love it I leave it on for about 30 to 45 minutes and then I just take my toner and I take a cotton swab and then wipe the mess off of my face with it that's another thing that I love about this mask because I don't have to wash it off with water I like masks that I can just take off with a toner it's super moisturizing so I love to use it right after I use a clay mask or any mask that's really purifying because it brings all of the moisture back into my face it's never let me down and everyone that I this mask on yes how many people try my stuff I think people who come over and I put the mask on that whether male or female has been so impressed by how well it works if I ever had to just take one mask that was super moisturizing it would be this one next pasta half is a parsley seed antioxidant serum and it has grape seed pessimal and parsley seed in it and it says a rich antioxidant do used moisturizer or normal to combination and sensitive skin it has grape and parsley seeds extra in it and after you cleanse until you're supposed to apply it to your hands and massage it into your face I'm new to using serums as a moisturizer as always use creams or gels on my face so this was different for me but it's pretty much almost finished because I really liked it and you just take a couple drops you put it onto your face I actually put it directly on to my face because I feel like that way I don't waste any product by sinking into my palms I bought that product on accident I meant to get the potent like small parsley seed antioxidant product but I got the wrong one and I ended up with bids but I actually liked it I used it the most in the winter time I used it during the day I would actually layer this underneath the parsley seed antioxidants actual lotion and my face was just like unbelievably moisturized moisture to a whole nother level but just using this product by itself it's fine it works as a moisturizer my face felt hydrated it felt moisturize I feel like I necessarily needed to put anything over it in the summer time I think this is going to be awesome for anyone who has oily to combination skin because it sinks into your skin and you don't need to put on a lotion and so it's light its Airy you can go out and not worry about feeling greasy now it's something I'll run out and go repurchase I wouldn't I wouldn't I probably would never repurchase that because it wasn't mind blowing it makes me just go wow my face looks so amazing it was just a good product so if you're looking for something like that I would go with it I didn't break out and have any adverse effects at all with it this next product is the bitter orange astringent toner and it has bitter orange in it witch hazel rosemary leaf and it's a toner that's supposed to help to smooth your face with a matte finish and you just will sees a cotton pad and rub it on your neck in your forehead so I just started using this toner about a month ago and I was just in need of a toner and it trusts ESOP so I went with it without really doing any research and that's another thing about this brand there's not that many reviews on YouTube I searched up and down when I first started getting into it try to find reviews so that I can know before I spend all that money but the reviews on YouTube were really scarce so I felt like I really needed to come back and do a review on all of these things so this toner is pretty good in my opinion it works I wasn't blown away by it but then again I'm not necessarily blown away by toners I do love my Chanel toner for the winter time it's awesome but this does the job it takes off all of the makeup or whatever residue or dirt was left on my face after washing and it works the smell is not my favorite I don't really like the way it smells and once again it does have rosemary in it so that might be what I'm smelling I wouldn't necessarily call this a gentle toner because you do feel that kind of sting that you feel and I think that's the witch hazel in it but it's not stripping at all my face doesn't feel like it was stripped after using it I think it's fine I'm not quite sure if I would ever repurchase it if it was available and I saw it maybe if I needed one but I would run out to go get it again the next part I have is called remove and it has grapeseed oil tocopherol which is vitamin E and blue chamomile and it's a gentle eye makeup remover that's oil-based so I bought this because I was running out of my Chanel eye makeup remover which is my favorite so I decided to try this one it's really tiny if you look at how small this is I wasn't expecting it to be this little this is the toner and this is a six point eight of the cleansing oil so you can see how small it is it's tiny it's only two fluid ounces and it's an eye makeup remover I did not like this product it really sticks on to your cotton pad as you're using it even though it's an oil I select it kind of soaks into the cotton pad and it doesn't give you a whole lot to work with I just didn't like the feeling it was what a feeling I felt on my fingertip with the cotton pad and the oil it just something about it did not work out for me this smells okay I wasn't crazy about the scent but it's not very strong I just don't think this pot is necessary I can take my makeup off with other things that are a lot less expensive I thought this was going to kind of like blow me away but in my opinion it's oh look at that it's a damp it's this a damp cotton pad look see I wasn't even following the direction I'm gonna have to wait on my review on this one because I just read that the cotton pad is supposed to be damp and I definitely never let it that's the thing about these kinds of products you have to use them the way that you're instructed to use them before you can say whether or not it works so I'm gonna have to get back to you on this this next product is the parsley seed antioxidant hydrator with white tea patent all willow herb in it and it's a light rapid absorbing facial moisturizing fluid that delivers super antioxidant hydration this is definitely my favorite moisturizer for the winter I've purchased this twice already and I love it I absolutely love it it's so thick and rich smell amazing and after I use it instantly my skin is plumped instantly hydrated instantly plump really supple looking very soft it does have a little bit of craziness to it there's a little bit of grease you can't use too much you only need a tiny amount I would say about half a dime-sized you just need a little bit if you put a lot on your face it's going to look a little bit oily a little bit greasy even under makeup using it my makeup would go on so flawlessly like I said if you use too much it can be a problem especially if you use a primer because of how thick this is it kind of turns into this kind of like grainy white text I can't really explain it but it's just it's a no-go it's not good so you need to use only a little bit within like two days of using the cleansing oil and this particular product my face was noticeably more supple so this is something I was definitely repurchase it says it's ideal for fatigue skin exposed to drying environment such as an office base or an airline cabin it refreshes and tones of skin like an congested by humidity or pollution so this is an interesting little product I wasn't when I initially bought it I bought it to use as a toner but I realized that it could have better uses this is one of those facial sprays that you use that are in an airplane you want to freshen up your face because you know your skin does kind of get yucky when you travel it's really small so you can put it in your purse or your bag and I like it I like the way it mists out the quality isn't the quality of the mister is really good because it does have a really clean light sprit I've never used it over makeup to see if it was like a setting spray but that's not how it's marketed so it's truly just to refresh your face I think it's a nice product it has a pretty decent smell kind of orangie I would repurchase it because I don't really need it and I really only want to keep things that I'm like in love with and not just things to have so I will finish it but it's not something that I'm going to repurchase another way I use it is right before I go to the gym I bring my face with it just to kind of refresh my face and tone it because I do wash my face right before I go to the gym all right you guys that was a lot that was a lot but thank you so much for sticking with me let me know if you have any questions about these products I love Esau I love the brand this isn't sponsored I purchased all of this with my own money but eats up if you do want to sponsor me I would be more than happy to do that because I love this brand if you get a chance to actually go into an esop store you should because it is mixed there and the ambiance of it is really nice it's really neat you can try out all the products inside the store they have lots of big sinks and the people who work with you are really knowledgeable they're really sweet and they'll help you find whatever it is that you need or give you samples to try out before you spend the money on it so let me know if you guys have any questions if you don't because to you all nuts thank you so much for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wqAgNdFDo&ab_channel=EmmaCaitlain,hey guys welcome back to my channel today i wanted to share with you a bunch of products that i picked up in a recent shop that i did at esop so it's a little bit of a haul because i was restocking a bunch of things around my home and the reason why i love these products and by the way these have all been bought with my own money they're not gifted i wish so the reason i really love them is because they're very aesthetic so they look really beautiful sitting around the house or displayed and i also am obsessed with their stores i think it's one of the best retail experiences because you kind of walk in they're all extremely unique and done by local designers which is something that is really cool for me being a designer myself and i think their product ethos is amazing there are a lot of natural ingredients they all smell beautiful the people in the store talk like this so you feel really calm and i just think it's amazing that they give you so many different samples and they've got anything from spf to skin care to just kind of little bits and pieces around the house so i'm going to show you through everything that i picked up and if you are new here just a super quick reminder don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and hit that subscribe button i put up new videos every single week now let's get into the first product my favorite product and i guess one that's a little bit on the cheaper side so if you were just kind of wanting it for aesthetic purposes then this is a really good place to start so that is the esop mouthwash so i'm not even going to try and pronounce it the way that they say it underneath but the flavors if you will in this is clove bud star anise and spearmint leaf this is so nice it's so so refreshing and it's not harsh like normal mouthwashes that i guess have a little bit of alcohol and things in it to really kill the bacteria this is more just like an oral hygiene kind of thing i think it's just like so you've always got fresh breath and i think the bottle is so beautiful it also did come with a little glass beaker on top but mine smashed unfortunately i think it was a little bit undersized for the bottle so definitely check that in the store before you take it home because the beaker would have been really nice and then it kind of covers like this plastic lid which is a little bit naff but i love this and i guess if you didn't want to be spending you know 25 or whatever on mouthwash you could probably just buy it once and then refill the bottle with whatever mouthwash you normally use so this is definitely one of my staple products and something that i honestly just keep going back and buying all the time the next product i really love from them and something that's really nice to have if you've got guests coming to stay and you want to put some little things on the end of their bed for them to have their own little products while they're staying with you is the cleansing bar so this is a body cleansing slab by esop and it is bergamot rind langlang and tahitian lime it smells so good and it really moisturizes your skin which i love so this is what it looks like it's literally just a baby soap bar and i just think this is so sweet it honestly it just smells amazing and i think it's a really really nice little gift to give to someone or just something really great to have in your shower because i know like often when you go to the shops and you buy a bar of soap it's enormous and i get that they're just trying to give you good value for money but i find if you leave a soap bar in the shower for too long it goes really manky and i end up wanting to throw it out which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a huge soap bar and having the big value in the first place so i really like this one because as you can see it's like smaller than the palm of my hand and i find that i actually just end up using and finishing the bar instead of wasting any of it the next product is also quite an affordable one from them and a definite essential given the whole situation we've just gone through this last year and that is hand sanitizer so i keep this one with me in my handbag and i also have one at work on my desk i hate really strong and harsh sanitizers i think you know when you go to the chemist or somewhere out and about and they ask you to sanitize your hands before walking into the store i have my own because i hate those ones that are super super strong and they almost like make your hands really dry as well i feel like my hands were just getting completely dried out after all of that so this one is called the resurrection rinse free hand wash and it's mandarin rind rosemary leaf and cedar atlas whatever that is and it is an alcohol-based one as well so it is a proper hand sanitizer that will do the job and it just smells divine so this is another really great staple from esop so on the topic of dry hands that was something i really struggled with because i'm someone who loves to slather themselves in moisturizer so feeling like my hands were kind of getting attacked during the pandemic especially in winter which already ordinarily dries out your skin i wanted to get a hand balm so i got this one this is called the balm or balm aromatic and it just comes in this little tube which again you can just pop in your handbag so super convenient size it is the same kind of scents and ingredients as the hand sanitizer so it's mandarin rind rosemary leafs and cedar atlas and it's just a really amazing moisturizing hand balm i'll show you what some of it looks like sorry this is a new one so i've got to pierce the lid um but it's just this little yellow kind of colored um balm and it's quite thick without being like claggy i guess which is also really nice i don't like when you kind of put on hand bums and they're like i don't know a little bit too oily and stuff because then it sort of just feels a little bit gross and you end up wanting to wash it off now because i love that one so much i actually have it in the bigger size as well and this was initially bought because i just absolutely love the packaging of these tubes i've seen these things you can get where you can kind of like roll up the tube on a little metal thing um if you know where to buy those please let me know because i have no idea and it didn't come with one of those but that would be really really handy but like i said again it's the exact same ingredients this one is just the bigger size in this really cool looking tube and this is my one that i keep at home in my bathroom something that i use every single morning to wake me up before i go to the gym because i do a 6 a.m pilates class is this one and it's the immediate moisture facial hydrosol so this one is just like a little bit of a spritzing spray i guess if we were traveling i would definitely take this with me on the plane i feel like years ago when i was younger i would always just put on like a full face of makeup so i looked good on the plane and now these days i'm all about hydrating and moisturizing so i would be drinking a ton of water and putting on all of my skincare products and just making sure i arrive feeling really hydrated so this was something that i discovered a little while ago so this is rose petal bergamot peel and chamomile bud and it's an invigorating spray on hydration to relieve all skin types now i just love this i know but some people probably don't like the idea of being like spritzed in the face when you first wake up in the morning but for me i really like it and it's definitely um like a solid part of my morning routine i just really really enjoy it and i definitely feel like it wakes me up a little bit so i can get in the mood to work out now this is an old one and it has been floating around the bottom of my handbag so i aimed you to go and get it again and it's this lip balm so this is a really tiny little size one and it's kind of in a tube so this is a little bit um impractical i guess because it sort of just does this can you see what it's doing it's literally just like coming out of the tube so i probably will not buy this again because it does this every time and i have absolutely no idea why but it's so annoying and it weighs so much of the product but anyway this is called the rose hip c rose hip seed lip cream and it's rose hip seed to sephiral and langling and it's to hydrate your lips but i'm hoping that they've got one that's more just in like a i don't know like a little lip smacker looking kind of tube instead for lip balm because like i said that one was just a pretty bad purchase i think it would make a really cute gift but it's just not practical something i am definitely on board with now and i never used to be really good at using is spf so don't be like me go and get yourself an spf now i don't use the really really strong ones because this is my natural skin tone i actually haven't faked hands this week at all so i am a little bit more on the olive side i'm not super fair so i am able to get away with an spf 25 but i do believe they also have spf 50 as well so this one is the protective facial lotion and it's got green tea pantheral and sephoral and it is a broad spectrum sunscreen for daily use i love this it comes in a pump bottle and it's just the best formulation it's not too greasy or thick and it sits really well under makeup so that was an absolutely amazing find from them and it really wasn't too expensive compared to some other brands that i like like laroche posse and those kind of ones the last thing i want to show you was a definite splurge because i normally wouldn't want to spend this much on a daily facial moisturizer because of how quickly we obviously go through these kind of products but it's this one called the seeking silence facial hydrator and this is my sort of like not everyday moisturizer i would say i just put this one on when i'm not wearing makeup because i don't want to waste it by like potentially not actually soaking in under makeup so this one is squalane ginger root and bizabalol whatever that is absolutely no idea it's a lightweight hydrating fluid formulated to bring a sense of calm to sensitive skin now you may have noticed in some videos occasionally that i suffered from a bunch of breakouts on my forehead so last year i was actually hospitalized i had high grade cervical dysplasia so that was quite stressful and if you haven't got a pap smear recently this is your sign please please book yourselves in and always get checked regularly because i do and i did at the time and that is exactly how they found it out for me but what happened after that operation was i think all of my hormones and things in my body just went completely whack and i suffered from really bad breakouts on my forehead that were almost like acne actually and i've never had that in my life i've always been quite blessed to have clear skin so i really really needed to find a bunch of sensitive products hence going to esop because a lot of their stuff is really geared towards very sensitive skin and it's a really light touch so that was the moisturizer that i selected and that was really just to help me get my skin hydrated again and to kind of not cause any further irritation and really really calm down a lot of the redness and things that i was suffering from at the time so yeah i think it was really really good product for that it was very effective but it was pretty expensive i think it was 65 or something for that teeny tiny tub so up to you if you want to spend that much on a moisturizer if you're looking for a really luxe shopping experience and a great product then i would but yeah so that is it for my esop haul these are all my favorite products if you guys have any others that i am yet to discover then please leave them down in the comments below i would love to check them out the other range that i did really like is the parsley seed ones but i just haven't got around to going in and shopping for them because i'm trying to be a little bit budget conscious at the moment so that is it for today's video thank you guys so much for watching and i will see you next time bye you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdJNoCwP04o&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,hi everyone so today I will be reading all the ASA products that I have tried and what I'm going to do is for each product I will talk about what I like the most about it what I dislike and if I would buy them again and so first I'm just gonna give a brief overview so I do have quite the Aesop collection um this is my skin care products and then I also do have some of their body care products as well so for I will be going into skincare first so first we're going to talk about the Aesop cleanser so this is a fabulous face wash and as you can see um it is almost out so I really really do like this cleanser and for context my skin is oily combination sensitive um sensitive oily but mainly in my t-zones so the fabulous face wash I really like this product I have used uh the use of the people cleanser before but I felt like it just isn't that interesting so I decided to try this Aesop face wash and I really like the way it feels on my face because it feels very cleansing but it does not feel stripping and it just smells so good and it just feels amazing so I will definitely be repurchasing this one thing however that I would like to know is that the pump is a little bit annoying when you are traveling so if you have this in like a bag or something um it's gonna spill I mean there's just I couldn't figure out a way to like package this without spilling but I probably wasted at least a third of the bottle because um it spilled out when I have been traveling and I believe this product this is a 200 millimeters um it has lasted me since I think maybe April of this year and as I did say before um I just spilled about a third of this bottle so it is September now so and it's still going quite strong so and for this you only really need a tiny tiny bit so I love the cleanser okay so now to continue we're going into the toner B and T balancing toner so I just started using this toner but before I started using it I have um used a travel like a sample size of the toner and I really liked it so um I decided to purchase a faux bottle this is the 200 millimeter as well and actually even though it's in like a car form it's very easily to dispense and it only dispenses a few drops at a time so I think that's really convenient but I like this because it's alcohol free and it's very soothing for your face but it still does the job of a toner however I will say that um I don't think this product is spectacular not like the face wash so I would give this product maybe like a six out of ten in terms of also just a price because this is pretty expensive I believe this toner is about 60 dollars for the 200 milligram but I did buy it on sale from the website if Chic so um sometimes you can find them on else so I think that's a good tip but yeah I will say that if you are looking for a toner this does the job but I will say that there probably are better toners out on the market but this is a really solid product that you know is a good staple routine if you're just looking for something simple okay and then to continue I have the fur mask so I have the Primrose facial cleansing mask this is also in 120 milligram milliliters so the bigger size so this I have also tried before I purchased um one thing I love about Aesop is that they have a lot of samples so you can really just try out their products before you purchase and these products are pretty pricey so I definitely recommend that um I also believe this was around sixty dollars and it is a clay mask as you can see um but I really really like this clay mask I think that this clay mask feels really really great on my face and it draws out like my oils and impurities like I couldn't visibly kind of see it like drawing it out and also this clay mask feels very comfortable and does not feel too tight and also too harsh on my skin um I have pretty sensitive skin so I'm always looking for products that are gentle but still gets the job done however with that said I don't think this is a perfect mask or anything like that um I will give this a 7.5 out of 10. and I'll just do rate also the fabulous face wash I would give this a 9 out of 10. yes and then to continue so I have the parsley seed antioxidant intense serum this Serum is quite expensive at 98 after tax um so you know I should really pack a punch but I will say though I bought this serum in May and it is September so it's been three months and I've used about one third of the bottle so it does last quite a long time um so this serum promises it I bought it because it promises to um form a breathable antioxidant film on the skin and I actually do believe that this serves the purpose well obviously I can't you know scientifically prove that it forms an antioxidant layer but I do feel like this Serum is great for protecting my skin and I do think it is a really great serum it feels super super good on the skin and once you get again you only need about two drops of this serum so and it's not too oily it's not too heavy um I love the way it feels but I do think the price point is a little bit steep um I would buy this again but but I would just because it's 98 dollars um I would rate it at 8 out of 10 but I do think that this delivers to what it does so I think this is a pretty good product okay and then to round out the skincare routine I have the lightweight facial hydrating serum this is actually my second bottle so you can tell I love this serum and for context um I think the first bottle lasted me four months which I think is a pretty long time for a moisturizer so this bottle I think is around 60 dollars once again a little bit steep uh but I do love love this moisturizer um this is the first thing I tried at Aesop and this is the product that really like sold me on Aesop so I recommend this moisturizer I think it's just a great overall moisturizer and it just it's for combo oily or sensitive skin which I believe I have all three so um this moisturizer feels really really great on my face but once again I do think this is best for oily skin so if your skin is not oily um I would not recommend this but I think this is a great moisturizer um actually would give this a 10 out of 10. I I really really love this moisturizer just when you put it on like it feels so soothing and even though it seems like it's oil based or it's not oil based but the droplets are quite thick um it does not feel thick on your face at all I think it feels amazing and I love this product okay and then I think the last thing I have about skin care is the Aesop um lip balm I actually got this for free from Aesop but I believe it's 15 if you buy it um I think that's a little bit ridiculous for a lip balm although this does have SPF um it just it's just a lip balm you know and I don't even think this is a great lip balm because it kind of when you put it on your lips um the lip balm is very rigid so it doesn't feel as nourishing as some of the other lip balms I've tried but you know it is a lip balm so it does its job and it does have SPF which is great but just for 15 dollars um I think you can get something better this is pretty basic I would give this a 5 out of 10. so yeah okay so now moving on to the hair care products so I do have the Aesop shampoo and conditioner in the bigger size I think this is the 500 milliliters and these are fifty dollars each so a hundred dollars for a set um so for shampoo I have the equalizing shampoo which is for a balancing formulation for those with oilier scalps to remove excess oil without causing aggravation and then I just have the normal conditioner um I don't think they have that many other conditioners so I will compare my hair care products to olaplex because I um used to use olaplex but I will say that I do really like the shampoo and conditioner first of all especially the way it smells it just smells amazing especially the conditioner it smells so good like um so the shampoo I think cleanses my hair really well um like I said it is for if you have a oilier scalp so definitely do not buy this if you have fine hair but um also I like that you know it's 500 milliliters I believe the olaplex shampoo is about half the size and it's 30 dollars so I think value wise um I think that the shampoo and conditioner are decent values because I think it will last a long time since the shampoo I only need to use um about I would say either a full pump or half a pump depending on how dirty my hair is so but once again I don't think their shampoo and conditioners are magical it's not magical it kind of just does what it says it does it's not going to go you know above and beyond um so at this price point it is a little steep I would say I would give the shampoo and conditioner both a 7.5 out of 10. and I probably would buy again depending on how long it lasts but I think I will buy again and then for this conditioner um honestly yeah the shampoo I think I would give a 7.5 out of 10 but I think in a conditioner I'll give a 6.5 out of 10 because I just feel like it is nourishing and it is great on my hair but um you know I think it could be a little better like it could be more it could be giving more for how mature pain but the conditioner smells so good that I think I would buy it again just because of how great it smells I I just I love the scent it smells so good so yeah and then my last hair care product is actually the rose hair and scalp moisturizing mask um so this is the 120 milliliter size um I think this is about thirty dollars I don't remember um also I will say that ASAP in Europe is cheaper than the price in America so if you can't try to buy in Europe um I don't really love this mask it's a hydrating mask but I'm also just a little bit lazy because the way this mask works is uh um you apply it to like washed hair but you do have to wash the hair mask out and I'm a little bit lazy so honestly I don't really use this that much but I should use it more um I think it does get the job done it's for you know scalp if your scalp is dry but I think my scalp isn't dry so this just isn't really the product for me I probably shouldn't have bought it but I do think it is a hydrating hair mask but um I just don't really love hair masks so I would not buy this again I'm not like that impressed I'm just gonna try to um use this up because you know I'm not gonna waste my money but I wouldn't buy this again I give this like a 4 out of ten I think you could just buy any hair masks that's cheaper and they probably will do the same thing this is not nothing revolutionary okay so my last ASAP product is the Aesop mouthwash so first of all I just love this bottle and I love that it comes with this really cute like mouthwash Beaker um it's just so cute like that's the reason I bought it not for you know a mouthwash purpose but just because it's so cute and I will say this is the best tasting mouthwash I have ever tried it is but it is crazy overpriced this mouthwash is 29 and it really does not last that long I think I used it for a month and a half and it went out so I actually refilled it with a different mouthwash because I am not buying 30 Mouse wash again um that was just like a one-time thing so I think the mouth I mean if you have the money I say go for it because it's a gray mouthwash um it tastes really good but does it need to be 30 dollars no it does not so I think the mouthwash 5 out of 10 um will not purchase it again just because it is expensive but you know once again she is beautiful she tastes amazing so yeah okay and that is all for today for my Aesop skin care and body hair products I hope you like this video um please like comment and let me know what you think thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wqAgNdFDo&pp=ygUMYWVzb3AgcmV2aWV3,hey guys welcome back to my channel today i wanted to share with you a bunch of products that i picked up in a recent shop that i did at esop so it's a little bit of a haul because i was restocking a bunch of things around my home and the reason why i love these products and by the way these have all been bought with my own money they're not gifted i wish so the reason i really love them is because they're very aesthetic so they look really beautiful sitting around the house or displayed and i also am obsessed with their stores i think it's one of the best retail experiences because you kind of walk in they're all extremely unique and done by local designers which is something that is really cool for me being a designer myself and i think their product ethos is amazing there are a lot of natural ingredients they all smell beautiful the people in the store talk like this so you feel really calm and i just think it's amazing that they give you so many different samples and they've got anything from spf to skin care to just kind of little bits and pieces around the house so i'm going to show you through everything that i picked up and if you are new here just a super quick reminder don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and hit that subscribe button i put up new videos every single week now let's get into the first product my favorite product and i guess one that's a little bit on the cheaper side so if you were just kind of wanting it for aesthetic purposes then this is a really good place to start so that is the esop mouthwash so i'm not even going to try and pronounce it the way that they say it underneath but the flavors if you will in this is clove bud star anise and spearmint leaf this is so nice it's so so refreshing and it's not harsh like normal mouthwashes that i guess have a little bit of alcohol and things in it to really kill the bacteria this is more just like an oral hygiene kind of thing i think it's just like so you've always got fresh breath and i think the bottle is so beautiful it also did come with a little glass beaker on top but mine smashed unfortunately i think it was a little bit undersized for the bottle so definitely check that in the store before you take it home because the beaker would have been really nice and then it kind of covers like this plastic lid which is a little bit naff but i love this and i guess if you didn't want to be spending you know 25 or whatever on mouthwash you could probably just buy it once and then refill the bottle with whatever mouthwash you normally use so this is definitely one of my staple products and something that i honestly just keep going back and buying all the time the next product i really love from them and something that's really nice to have if you've got guests coming to stay and you want to put some little things on the end of their bed for them to have their own little products while they're staying with you is the cleansing bar so this is a body cleansing slab by esop and it is bergamot rind langlang and tahitian lime it smells so good and it really moisturizes your skin which i love so this is what it looks like it's literally just a baby soap bar and i just think this is so sweet it honestly it just smells amazing and i think it's a really really nice little gift to give to someone or just something really great to have in your shower because i know like often when you go to the shops and you buy a bar of soap it's enormous and i get that they're just trying to give you good value for money but i find if you leave a soap bar in the shower for too long it goes really manky and i end up wanting to throw it out which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a huge soap bar and having the big value in the first place so i really like this one because as you can see it's like smaller than the palm of my hand and i find that i actually just end up using and finishing the bar instead of wasting any of it the next product is also quite an affordable one from them and a definite essential given the whole situation we've just gone through this last year and that is hand sanitizer so i keep this one with me in my handbag and i also have one at work on my desk i hate really strong and harsh sanitizers i think you know when you go to the chemist or
